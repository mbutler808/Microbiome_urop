AB  - Skin microbiota of Gulf of Mexico fishes were investigated by ribosomal internal 
      spacer analysis (RISA) and 16S rRNA gene sequencing. A total of 102 fish 
      specimens representing six species (Mugil cephalus, Lutjanus campechanus, 
      Cynoscion nebulosus, Cynoscion arenarius, Micropogonias undulatus, and Lagodon 
      rhomboides) were sampled at regular intervals throughout a year. The skin 
      microbiota from each individual fish was analyzed by RISA and produced complex 
      profiles with 23 bands on average. Similarities between RISA profiles ranged from 
      97.5% to 4.0%. At 70% similarity, 11 clusters were defined, each grouping 
      individuals from the same fish species. Multidimensional scaling and analysis of 
      similarity correlated the RISA-defined clusters with geographic locality, date, 
      and fish species. Global R values indicated that fish species was the most 
      indicative variable for group separation. Analysis of 16S rRNA gene sequences 
      (from pooled samples of 10 individual fish for each fish species) showed that the 
      Proteobacteria was the predominant phylum in skin microbiota, followed by the 
      Firmicutes and the Actinobacteria. The distribution and abundance of bacterial 
      sequences were different among all species analyzed. Aeribacillus was found in 
      all fish species representing 19% of all clones sequenced, while some genera were 
      fish species-specific (Neorickettsia in M. cephalus and Microbacterium in L. 
      campechanus). Our data provide evidence for the existence of specific skin 
      microbiota associated with particular fish species.
