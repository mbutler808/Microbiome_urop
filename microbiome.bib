@article{Madison:2023,
	abstract = {The use of museum specimens for research in microbial evolutionary
   ecology remains an under-utilized investigative dimension with important
   potential. Despite this potential, there remain barriers in methodology
   and analysis to the wide-spread adoption of museum specimens for such
   studies. Here, we hypothesized that there would be significant
   differences in taxonomic prediction and related diversity among sample
   type (museum or fresh) and sequencing strategy (medium-depth shotgun
   metagenomic or 16S rRNA gene). We found dramatically higher predicted
   diversity from shotgun metagenomics when compared to 16S rRNA gene
   sequencing in museum and fresh samples, with this differential being
   larger in museum specimens. Broadly confirming these hypotheses, the
   highest diversity found in fresh samples was with shotgun sequencing
   using the Rep200 reference inclusive of viruses and microeukaryotes,
   followed by the WoL reference database. In museum-specimens, community
   diversity metrics also differed significantly between sequencing
   strategies, with the alpha-diversity ACE differential being
   significantly greater than the same comparisons made for fresh
   specimens. Beta diversity results were more variable, with significance
   dependent on reference databases used. Taken together, these findings
   demonstrate important differences in diversity results and prompt
   important considerations for future experiments and downstream analyses
   aiming to incorporate microbiome datasets from museum specimens.},

@article{Goodwin:2022,
	abstract = {Host-associated microbiomes play important roles in host health and
   pathogen defense. In amphibians, the skin-associated microbiota can
   contribute to innate immunity with potential implications for disease
   management. Few studies have examined season-long temporal variation in
   the amphibian skin-associated microbiome, and the interactions between
   bacteria and fungi on amphibian skin remain poorly understood. We
   characterize season-long temporal variation in the skin-associated
   microbiome of the western tiger salamander (Ambystoma mavortium) for
   both bacteria and fungi between sites and across salamander life stages.
   Two hundred seven skin-associated microbiome samples were collected from
   salamanders at two Rocky Mountain lakes throughout the summer and fall
   of 2018, and 127 additional microbiome samples were collected from lake
   water and lake substrate. We used 16S rRNA and ITS amplicon sequencing
   with Bayesian Dirichlet-multinomial regression to estimate the relative
   abundances of bacterial and fungal taxa, test for differential
   abundance, examine microbial selection, and derive alpha diversity. We
   predicted the ability of bacterial communities to inhibit the amphibian
   chytrid fungus Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis (Bd), a cutaneous fungal
   pathogen, using stochastic character mapping and a database of
   Bd-inhibitory bacterial isolates. For both bacteria and fungi, we
   observed variation in community composition through time, between sites,
   and with salamander age and life stage. We further found that temporal
   trends in community composition were specific to each combination of
   salamander age, life stage, and lake. We found salamander skin to be
   selective for microbes, with many taxa disproportionately represented
   relative to the environment. Salamander skin appeared to select for
   predicted Bd-inhibitory bacteria, and we found a negative relationship
   between the relative abundances of predicted Bd-inhibitory bacteria and
   Bd. We hope these findings will assist in the conservation of amphibian
   species threatened by chytridiomycosis and other emerging diseases.},

@article{Walters:2016,
	abstract = {Designing primers for PCR-based taxonomic surveys that amplify a broad
   range of phylotypes in varied community samples is a difficult
   challenge, and the comparability of data sets amplified with varied
   primers requires attention. Here, we examined the performance of
   modified 16S rRNA gene and internal transcribed spacer (ITS) primers for
   archaea/bacteria and fungi, respectively, with nonaquatic samples. We
   moved primer bar codes to the 5' end, allowing for a range of different
   3' primer pairings, such as the 515f/926r primer pair, which amplifies
   variable regions 4 and 5 of the 16S rRNA gene. We additionally
   demonstrated that modifications to the 515f/806r (variable region 4) 16S
   primer pair, which improves detection of Thaumarchaeota and clade SAR11
   in marine samples, do not degrade performance on taxa already amplified
   effectively by the original primer set. Alterations to the fungal ITS
   primers did result in differential but overall improved performance
   compared to the original primers. In both cases, the improved primers
   should be widely adopted for amplicon studies.
   IMPORTANCE We continue to uncover a wealth of information connecting
   microbes in important ways to human and environmental ecology. As our
   scientific knowledge and technical abilities improve, the tools used for
   microbiome surveys can be modified to improve the accuracy of our
   techniques, ensuring that we can continue to identify groundbreaking
   connections between microbes and the ecosystems they populate, from ice
   caps to the human body. It is important to confirm that modifications to
   these tools do not cause new, detrimental biases that would inhibit the
   field rather than continue to move it forward. We therefore demonstrated
   that two recently modified primer pairs that target taxonomically
   discriminatory regions of bacterial and fungal genomic DNA do not
   introduce new biases when used on a variety of sample types, from soil
   to human skin. This confirms the utility of these primers for
   maintaining currently recommended microbiome research techniques as the
   state of the art.},

@article{Loyau:2024,
	abstract = {Microbial assemblages naturally living on the skin are an integral part
   of immunity. In amphibians, this skin microbiota may hold a mitigation
   solution against the fungal pathogen Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis
   (Bd), which causes the panzootic disease chytridiomycosis. We used 16S
   rRNA gene metabarcoding to test the adaptive microbiome hypothesis. We
   compared the community composition, richness, and putative Bd-inhibitory
   function of the skin microbiome of three amphibian host species in the
   Pyrenees, as well as three species in Taiwan, in both Bd-positive and
   negative mountain populations. In both geographical regions, the
   amphibian host species played a decisive role in shaping the microbial
   assemblage and putative anti-Bd properties. In the Pyrenees, the species
   most susceptible to chytridiomycosis, Alytes obstetricans, had the
   lowest relative abundances of putative protective bacteria. In
   Bd-positive and negative sites, individuals had different skin
   microbiomes, with all anuran species showing increased relative
   abundances of potential anti-Bd bacteria, while the Taiwanese caudata
   Hynobius sonani showed the opposite pattern. Our results suggest that,
   in response to exposure to the pathogen, the skin microbiota shifted to
   a defensive state with increased anti-Bd function, which may contribute
   to promoting disease resistance, as proposed by the adaptive microbiome
   hypothesis.},

@article{Bellemain:2010,
	abstract = {Background: During the last 15 years the internal transcribed spacer
   (ITS) of nuclear DNA has been used as a target for analyzing fungal
   diversity in environmental samples, and has recently been selected as
   the standard marker for fungal DNA barcoding. In this study we explored
   the potential amplification biases that various commonly utilized ITS
   primers might introduce during amplification of different parts of the
   ITS region in samples containing mixed templates ('environmental
   barcoding'). We performed in silico PCR analyses with commonly used
   primer combinations using various ITS datasets obtained from public
   databases as templates.
   Results: Some of the ITS primers, such as ITS1-F, were hampered with a
   high proportion of mismatches relative to the target sequences, and most
   of them appeared to introduce taxonomic biases during PCR. Some primers,
   e. g. ITS1-F, ITS1 and ITS5, were biased towards amplification of
   basidiomycetes, whereas others, e.g. ITS2, ITS3 and ITS4, were biased
   towards ascomycetes. The assumed basidiomycete-specific primer ITS4-B
   only amplified a minor proportion of basidiomycete ITS sequences, even
   under relaxed PCR conditions. Due to systematic length differences in
   the ITS2 region as well as the entire ITS, we found that ascomycetes
   will more easily amplify than basidiomycetes using these regions as
   targets. This bias can be avoided by using primers amplifying ITS1 only,
   but this would imply preferential amplification of `non-dikarya' fungi.
   Conclusions: We conclude that ITS primers have to be selected carefully,
   especially when used for high-throughput sequencing of environmental
   samples. We suggest that different primer combinations or different
   parts of the ITS region should be analyzed in parallel, or that
   alternative ITS primers should be searched for.},

   dendrobatidis (Bd), is an infectious disease that causes population
   declines of many amphibians. Cutaneous bacteria isolated from redback
   salamanders, Plethodon cinereus, and mountain yellow-legged frogs, Rana
   muscosa, inhibit the growth of Bd in vitro. In this study, the bacterial
   community present on the skin of P. cinereus individuals was
   investigated to determine if it provides protection to salamanders from
   the lethal and sub-lethal effects of chytridiomycosis. When the
   cutaneous bacterial community was reduced prior to Bd exposure,
   salamanders experienced a significantly greater decrease in body mass,
   which is a symptom of the disease, when compared to infected individuals
   with a normal bacterial community. In addition, a greater proportion of
   infected individuals with a reduced bacterial community experienced
   limb-lifting, a behavior seen only in infected individuals. Overall,
   these results demonstrate that the cutaneous bacterial community of P.

The resulting assurance populations are managed under strict biosecure protocols, often involving artificial cycles of temperature and humidity to induce active and overwintering phases, which likely affect the bacterial symbionts living on the amphibian skin. However, the skin microbiota is an important first line of defense against pathogens that can cause amphibian declines, such as the chytrid <italic>Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis (Bd)</italic>. Determining whether current husbandry practices for assurance populations might deplete amphibians from their symbionts is therefore essential to conservation success. Here, we characterize the effect of the transitions from the wild to captivity, and between aquatic and overwintering phases, on the skin microbiota of two newt species. While our results confirm differential selectivity of skin microbiota between species, they underscore that captivity and phase-shifts similarly affect their community structure. More specifically, the translocation <italic>ex-situ</italic> is associated with rapid impoverishment, decrease in alpha diversity and strong species turnover of bacterial communities. Shifts between active and overwintering phases also cause changes in the diversity and composition of the microbiota, and on the prevalence of <italic>Bd</italic>-inhibitory phylotypes.

	abstract = {Healthy wings are vital for the survival and reproduction of bats, and
   wing microbiome is a key component of bat wing health. However,
   relatively little is known about the wing microbiome of bats in western
   Canada where the white nose syndrome has become an increasing threat.
   Here, we used DNA metabarcoding to investigate the bacterial and fungal
   communities on the wings of three bat species: the big brown bat
   (Eptesicus fuscus), the Yuma myotis (Myotis yumanensis), and the little
   brown myotis (M. lucifugus) from four field sites in Lillooet, British
   Columbia, Canada. The bacterial 16S rRNA metabarcoding revealed a total
   of 4,167 amplicon sequence variants (ASVs) belonging to 27 phyla, 639
   genera, and 533 known and 2,423 unknown species. The wing bacteria were
   dominated by phyla Proteobacteria, Firmicutes, Bacteroides, and
   Actinobacteria, and the most common genera were Delftia, Bordetella,
   Sphingomonas, Phyllobacterium, Bradyrhizobium, Pseudomonas, and
   Corynebacterium. The fungal internal transcribed spacer (ITS)
   metabarcoding revealed a total of 11,722 ASVs belonging to 16 phyla, 806
   genera, and 1,420 known and 10,302 unknown species. The wing fungi were
   dominated by phyla Ascomycota, Basidiomycota, and Motierellomycota, and
   the most common genera were Cladosporium, Aspergillus, and
   Mycosphaerella. Principal coordinates analysis showed that both bat
   species and field sites contributed variably to the diversity and
   distribution of bacterial and fungal communities on bat wings.
   Interestingly, both positive and negative correlations were found in
   their relative abundances among several groups of microbial taxa. We
   discuss the implications of our results for bat health, including the
   management of P. destructans infection and white-nose syndrome
   spread.IMPORTANCEMicrobiomes play important roles in host health.
   White-nose syndrome (WNS), a fungal infection of bat wings and muzzles,
   has threatened bat populations across North America since 2006. Recent
   research suggest that the skin microbiome of bats may play a significant
   role in bat's susceptibility to WNS. However, relatively little is known
   about the skin microbiome composition and function in bats in Western
   Canada, a region with a high diversity of bats, but WNS has yet to be a
   major issue. Here, we revealed high bacterial and fungal diversities on
   the skin of three common bat species in Lillooet, British Columbia,
   including several highly prevalent microbial species that have been
   rarely reported in other regions. Our analyses showed fine-scale
   structures of bat wing microbiome based on local sites and bat species.
   The knowledge obtained from WNS-na \& iuml;ve bat populations in this
   study may help develop mitigation and management strategies against WNS.

@article{Bates:2022,
	abstract = {Background: The fungal pathogen Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis (8d)
   threatens amphibian biodiversity and ecosystem stability worldwide.
   Amphibian skin microbial community structure has been linked to the
   clinical outcome of Bd infections, yet its overall functional importance
   is poorly understood.
   Methods: Microbiome taxonomic and functional profiles were assessed
   using high-throughput bacterial 16S rRNA and fungal ITS2 gene
   sequencing, bacterial shotgun metagenomics and skin mucosal
   metabolomics. We sampled 56 wild midwife toads (Alytes obstetricans)
   from montane populations exhibiting 8d epizootic or enzootic disease
   dynamics. In addition, to assess whether disease-specific microbiome
   profiles were linked to microbe-mediated protection or Bd-induced
   perturbation, we performed a laboratory 8d challenge experiment whereby
   40 young adult A. obstetricans were exposed to 8d or a control sham
   infection. We measured temporal changes in the microbiome as well as
   functional profiles of Bd-exposed and control animals at peak infection.
   Results: Microbiome community structure and function differed in wild
   populations based on infection history and in experimental control
   versus Bd-exposed animals. 8d exposure in the laboratory resulted in
   dynamic changes in microbiome community structure and functional
   differences, with infection clearance in all but one infected animal.
   Sphingobacterium, Stenotrophomonas and an unclassified Commamonadaceae
   were associated with wild epizootic dynamics and also had reduced
   abundance in laboratory Bd-exposed animals that cleared infection,
   indicating a negative association with 8d resistance. This was further
   supported by microbe-metabolite integration which identified
   functionally relevant taxa driving disease outcome, of which
   Sphingobacterium and 8d were most influential in wild epizootic
   dynamics. The strong correlation between microbial taxonomic community
   composition and skin metabolome in the laboratory and field is
   inconsistent with microbial functional redundancy, indicating that
   differences in microbial taxonomy drive functional variation. Shotgun
   metagenomic analyses support these findings, with similar
   disease-associated patterns in beta diversity. Analysis of
   differentially abundant bacterial genes and pathways indicated that
   bacterial environmental sensing and 8d resource competition are likely
   to be important in driving infection outcomes.
   Conclusions: 8d infection drives altered microbiome taxonomic and
   functional profiles across laboratory and field environments. Our
   application of multi-omics analyses in experimental and field settings
   robustly predicts 8d disease dynamics and identifies novel candidate
   biomarkers of infection.},

@article{Starke:2020,
	abstract = {Unveiling the relationship between phylogeny and function of the
   microbiome is crucial to determine its contribution to ecosystem
   functioning. However, while there is a considerable amount of
   information on microbial phylogenetic diversity, our understanding of
   its relationship to functional diversity is still scarce. Here we
   predicted the total microbiome functions of bacteria and fungi on Earth
   using the total known functions from level 3 of KEGG Orthology by
   modelling the increase of functions with increasing diversity of
   bacteria or fungi. For bacteria and fungi, the unsaturated model
   described the data significantly better (for both P < 2.2e-16),
   suggesting the presence of two types of functions. Widespread functions
   ubiquitous in every living organism that make up two thirds of our
   current knowledge of microbiome functions are separated from rare
   functions from specialised enzymes present in only a few species. Given
   previous estimates on species richness, we predicted a global total of
   35.5 million functions in bacteria and 3.2 million in fungi; of which
   only 0.02\% and 0.14\% are known today. Our approach highlights the
   necessity of novel and more sophisticated methods to unveil the entirety
   of rare functions to fully understand the involvement of the microbiome
   in ecosystem functioning.
   Significance: The functionality of and within a microbial community is
   generally inferred based on the taxonomic annotation of the organism.
   However, our understanding of functional diversity and how it relates to
   taxonomy is still limited. Here we predict the total microbiome
   functionality in bacteria and fungi on Earth using known and annotated
   protein-coding sequences in species accumulation curves. Our estimates
   reveal that the majority of functionality ( > 99\%) could be assigned to
   yet unknown and rare functions, highlighting that our current knowledge
   is incomplete and functional inference is thus lackluster.},

	abstract = {Emerging infectious diseases (EIDs) are caused by pathogens that have
   undergone recent changes in terms of geographic spread, increasing
   incidence, or expanding host range. In this narrative review, we
   describe three important fungal EIDs with keratin trophism that are
   relevant to reptile and amphibian conservation and veterinary practice.
   Nannizziopsis spp. have been mainly described in saurians; infection
   results in thickened, discolored skin crusting, with eventual
   progression to deep tissues. Previously only reported in captive
   populations, it was first described in wild animals in Australia in
   2020. Ophidiomyces ophidiicola (formely O. ophiodiicola) is only known
   to infect snakes; clinical signs include ulcerating lesions in the
   cranial, ventral, and pericloacal regions. It has been associated with
   mortality events in wild populations in North America. Batrachochytrium
   spp. cause ulceration, hyperkeratosis, and erythema in amphibians. They
   are a major cause of catastrophic amphibian declines worldwide. In
   general, infection and clinical course are determined by host-related
   characteristics (e.g., nutritional, metabolic, and immune status),
   pathogens (e.g., virulence and environmental survival), and environment
   (e.g., temperature, hygrometry, and water quality). The animal trade is
   thought to be an important cause of worldwide spread, with global
   modifications in temperature, hygrometry, and water quality further
   affecting fungal pathogenicity and host immune response.},

	abstract = {The skin is the first line of defense between an animal and its
   environment, and disruptions in skin-associated microorganisms can be
   linked to an animal's health and nutritional state. To better understand
   the skin microbiome of large whales, high-throughput sequencing of
   partial small subunit rRNA genes was used to study the skin-associated
   bacteria of 89 seemingly healthy humpback whales (Megaptera
   novaeangliae) sampled along the Western Antarctic Peninsula (WAP) during
   early (2010) and late (2013) austral summers. Six core groups of
   bacteria were present in 93\% or more of all humpback skin samples. A
   shift was observed in the average relative abundances of these core
   bacteria over time, with the emergence of four additional core groups of
   bacteria that corresponded to a decrease in water temperature, possibly
   caused by season-or foraging-related changes in skin biochemistry that
   influenced microbial growth, or other temporal factors. The skin
   microbiome differed between whales sampled at several regional locations
   along the WAP, suggesting that environmental factors or population may
   also influence the whale skin microbiome. Overall, the skin microbiome
   of humpback whales appears to provide insight into animal-and
   environment-related factors and may serve as a useful indicator for
   animal health or ecosystem alterations.
   IMPORTANCE The microbiomes of wild animals are currently understudied
   but may provide information about animal health and/or
   animal-environment interactions. In the largest sampling of any marine
   mammal microbiome, this study demonstrates conservation in the skin
   microbiome of 89 seemingly healthy humpback whales sampled in the
   Western Antarctic Peninsula, with shifts in the bacterial community
   composition related to temporal and regional variability. This study is
   important because it suggests that the skin microbiome of humpback
   whales could provide insight into animal nutritional or
   seasonal/environment-related factors, which are becoming increasingly
   important to recognize due to unprecedented rates of climate change and
   anthropogenic impact on ocean ecosystems.},

	abstract = {Diverse microbial assemblages inhabit amphibian skin and are known to
   differ among species; however, few studies have analysed these
   differences in systems that minimize confounding factors, such as
   season, location or host ecology. We used high-throughput amplicon
   sequencing to compare cutaneous microbiotas among two ranid frogs (Rana
   dalmatina, R. temporaria) and four salamandrid newts (Ichthyosaura
   alpestris, Lissotriton helveticus, L. vulgaris, Triturus cristatus)
   breeding simultaneously in two ponds near Braunschweig, Germany. We
   found that bacterial communities differed strongly and consistently
   between these two distinct amphibian clades. While frogs and newts had
   similar cutaneous bacterial richness, their bacterial composition
   strongly differed. Average Jaccard distances between frogs and newts
   were over 0.5, while between species within these groups distances were
   only 0.387 and 0.407 for frogs and newts, respectively. At the
   operational taxonomic unit (OTU) level, 31 taxa exhibited significantly
   different relative abundances between frogs and newts. This finding
   suggests that chemical or physical characteristics of these amphibians'
   mucosal environments provide highly selective conditions for bacterial
   colonizers. Multi-omics analyses of hosts and their microbiota as well
   as directed efforts to understand chemical differences in the mucosal
   environments (e.g. pH), and the specificities of host-produced compounds

	abstract = {Host-associated microbiomes are increasingly recognized to contribute to
   host disease resistance; the temporal dynamics of their community
   structure and function, however, are poorly understood. We investigated
   the cutaneous bacterial communities of three newt species, Ichthyosaura
   alpestris, Lissotriton vulgaris and Triturus cristatus, at approximately
   weekly intervals for 3 months using 16S ribosomal RNA amplicon
   sequencing. We hypothesized cutaneous microbiota would vary across time,
   and that such variation would be linked to changes in predicted
   fungal-inhibitory function. We observed significant temporal variation
   within the aquatic phase, and also between aquatic and terrestrial phase
   newts. By keeping T. cristatus in mesocosms, we demonstrated that
   structural changes occurred similarly across individuals, highlighting
   the non-stochastic nature of the bacterial community succession.
   Temporal changes were mainly associated with fluctuations in relative
   abundance rather than full turnover of bacterial operational taxonomic
   units (OTUs). Newt skin microbe fluctuations were not correlated with
   that of pond microbiota; however, a portion of community variation was
   explained by environmental temperature. Using a database of amphibian
   skin bacteria that inhibit the pathogen Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis
   (Bd), we found that the proportion of reads associated with
   `potentially' Bd-inhibitory OTUs did not vary temporally for two of
   three newt species, suggesting that protective function may be
   maintained despite temporal variation in community structure.},

@article{Bletz:2017b,
	abstract = {Host-associated microbiotas of vertebrates are diverse and complex
   communities that contribute to host health. In particular, for
   amphibians, cutaneous microbial communities likely play a significant
   role in pathogen defense; however, our ecological understanding of these
   communities is still in its infancy. Here, we take advantage of the
   fully endemic and locally species-rich amphibian fauna of Madagascar to
   investigate the factors structuring amphibian skin microbiota on a large
   scale. Using amplicon-based sequencing, we evaluate how multiple host
   species traits and site factors affect host bacterial diversity and
   community structure. Madagascar is home to over 400 native frog species,
   all of which are endemic to the island; more than 100 different species
   are known to occur in sympatry within multiple rainforest sites. We
   intensively sampled frog skin bacterial communities, from over 800
   amphibians from 89 species across 30 sites in Madagascar during three
   field visits, and found that skin bacterial communities differed
   strongly from those of the surrounding environment. Richness of
   bacterial operational taxonomic units (OTUs) and phylogenetic diversity
   differed among host ecomorphs, with arboreal frogs exhibiting lower
   richness and diversity than terrestrial and aquatic frogs. Host
   ecomorphology was the strongest factor influencing microbial community
   structure, with host phylogeny and site parameters (latitude and
   elevation) explaining less but significant portions of the observed
   variation. Correlation analysis and topological congruency analyses
   revealed little to no phylosymbiosis for amphibian skin microbiota.
   Despite the observed geographic variation and low phylosymbiosis, we
   found particular OTUs that were differentially abundant between
   particular ecomorphs. For example, the genus Pigmentiphaga
   (Alcaligenaceae) was significantly enriched on arboreal frogs,
   Methylotenera (Methylophilaceae) was enriched on aquatic frogs, and
   Agrobacterium (Rhizobiaceae) was enriched on terrestrial frogs. The
   presence of shared bacterial OTUs across geographic regions for selected
   host genera suggests the presence of core microbial communities which in
   Madagascar, might be driven more strongly by a species' preference for
   specific microhabitats than by the physical,physiological or biochemical
   properties of their skin. These results corroborate that both host and
   environmental factors are driving community assembly of amphibian
   cutaneous microbial communities, and provide an improved foundation for
   elucidating their role in disease resistance.},

	abstract = {For decades, Amphibians have been globally threatened by the still
   expanding infectious disease, chytridiomycosis. Madagascar is an
   amphibian biodiversity hotspot where Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis (Bd)
   has only recently been detected. While no Bd-associated population
   declines have been reported, the risk of declines is high when invasive
   virulent lineages become involved. Cutaneous bacteria contribute to host
   innate immunity by providing defense against pathogens for numerous
   animals, including amphibians. Little is known, however, about the
   cutaneous bacterial residents of Malagasy amphibians and the functional
   capacity they have against Bd. We cultured 3179 skin bacterial isolates
   from over 90 frog species across Madagascar, identified them via Sanger
   sequencing of approximately 700 bp of the 16S rRNA gene, and
   characterized their functional capacity against Bd. A subset of isolates
   was also tested against multiple Bd genotypes. In addition, we applied
   the concept of herd immunity to estimate Bd-associated risk for
   amphibian communities across Madagascar based on bacterial antifungal
   activity. We found that multiple bacterial isolates (39\% of all
   isolates) cultured from the skin of Malagasy frogs were able to inhibit
   Bd. Mean inhibition was weakly correlated with bacterial phylogeny, and
   certain taxonomic groups appear to have a high proportion of inhibitory
   isolates, such as the Enterobacteriaceae, Pseudomonadaceae, and
   Xanthamonadaceae (84, 80, and 75\% respectively). Functional capacity of
   bacteria against Bd varied among Bd genotypes; however, there were some
   bacteria that showed broad spectrum inhibition against all tested Bd
   genotypes, suggesting that these bacteria would be good candidates for
   probiotic therapies. We estimated Bd-associated risk for sampled
   amphibian communities based on the concept of herd immunity. Multiple
   amphibian communities, including those in the amphibian diversity
   hotspots, Andasibe and Ranomafana, were estimated to be below the 80\%
   herd immunity threshold, suggesting they may be at higher risk to
   chytridiomycosis if a lethal Bd genotype emerges in Madagascar. While
   this predictive approach rests on multiple assumptions, and incorporates
   only one component of hosts' defense against Bd, their culturable
   cutaneous bacterial defense, it can serve as a foundation for continued
   research on Bd-associated risk for the endemic frogs of Madagascar.},

   internal spacer analysis (RISA) and 16S rRNA gene sequencing. A total of
   102 fish specimens representing six species (Mugil cephalus, Lutjanus
   campechanus, Cynoscion nebulosus, Cynoscion arenarius, Micropogonias
   undulatus, and Lagodon rhomboides) were sampled at regular intervals
   throughout a year. The skin microbiota from each individual fish was
   analyzed by RISA and produced complex profiles with 23 bands on average.
   Similarities between RISA profiles ranged from 97.5\% to 4.0\%. At 70\%
   similarity, 11 clusters were defined, each grouping individuals from the
   same fish species. Multidimensional scaling and analysis of similarity
   correlated the RISA-defined clusters with geographic locality, date, and
   fish species. Global R values indicated that fish species was the most
   indicative variable for group separation. Analysis of 16S rRNA gene
   sequences (from pooled samples of 10 individual fish for each fish
   species) showed that the Proteobacteria was the predominant phylum in
   skin microbiota, followed by the Firmicutes and the Actinobacteria. The
   distribution and abundance of bacterial sequences were different among
   all species analyzed. Aeribacillus was found in all fish species
   representing 19\% of all clones sequenced, while some genera were fish
   species-specific (Neorickettsia in M. cephalus and Microbacterium in L.

@article{Sylvain:2020,
	abstract = {Teleost fish represent an invaluable repertoire of host species to study
   the factors shaping animal-associated microbiomes. Several studies have
   shown that the phylogenetic structure of the fish gut microbiome is
   driven by species-specific (e.g., host ancestry, genotype, or diet) and
   habitat-specific (e.g., hydrochemical parameters and bacterioplankton
   composition) factors. However, our understanding of other
   host-associated microbial niches, such as the skin mucus microbiome,
   remains limited. The goal of our study was to explore simultaneously the
   phylogenetic structure of the fish skin mucus and gut microbiome and
   compare the effect of speciesand habitat-specific drivers on the
   structure of microbial communities in both tissues. We sampled 114 wild
   fish from 6 populations of 3 ecologically and phylogenetically
   contrasting Amazonian teleost species. Water samples were collected at
   each site, and 10 physicochemical parameters were characterized. The
   skin mucus, gut, and water microbial communities were characterized
   using a metabarcoding approach targeting the V3-V4 regions of the 16S
   rRNA. Our results showed a significant distinction between the
   phylogenetic profile and diversity of the microbiome from each microbial
   niche. Skin mucus and bacterioplankton communities were significantly
   closer in composition than gut and free-living communities.
   Species-specific factors mostly modulated gut bacterial communities,
   while the skin mucus microbiome was predominantly associated with
   environmental physicochemistry and bacterioplankton community structure.
   These results suggest that the variable skin mucus community is a
   relevant target for the development of microbial biomarkers of
   environmental status, while the more conserved gut microbiome is better
   suited to study long-term host-microbe interactions over evolutionary
   time scales.
   IMPORTANCE Whether host-associated microbiomes are mostly shaped by
   species-specific or environmental factors is still unresolved. In
   particular, it is unknown to what extent microbial communities from two
   different host tissues from the same host respond to these factors. Our
   study is one of the first to focus on the microbiome of teleost fish to
   shed a light on this topic as we investigate how the phylogenetic
   structure of microbial communities from two distinct fish tissues are
   shaped by species- and habitat-specific factors. Our study showed that
   in contrast to the teleost gut microbiome, skin mucus communities are
   highly environment dependent. This result has various implications: (i)
   the skin mucus microbiome should be used, rather than the gut, to
   investigate bacterial biomarkers of ecosystem perturbance in the wild,
   and (ii) the gut microbiome is better suited for studies of the drivers
   of phylosymbiosis, or the coevolution of fish and their symbionts.},

@article{Troitsky:2023,
	abstract = {The skin of animals is enveloped by a symbiotic microscopic ecosystem
   known as the microbiome. The host and microbiome exhibit a mutualistic
   relationship, collectively forming a single evolutionary unit sometimes
   referred to as a holobiont. Although the holobiome theory highlights the
   importance of the microbiome, little is known about how the skin
   microbiome contributes to protecting the host. Existing studies focus on
   humans or captive animals, but research in wild animals is in its
   infancy. Specifically, the protective role of the skin microbiome in
   hibernating animals remains almost entirely overlooked. This is
   surprising, considering the massive population declines in hibernating
   North American bats caused by the fungal pathogen Pseudogymnoascus
   destructans, which causes white-nose syndrome. Hibernation offers a
   unique setting in which to study the function of the microbiome because,
   during torpor, the host's immune system becomes suppressed, making it
   susceptible to infection. We conducted a systematic review of
   peer-reviewed literature on the protective role of the skin microbiome
   in non-human animals. We selected 230 publications that mentioned
   pathogen inhibition by microbes residing on the skin of the host animal.
   We found that the majority of studies were conducted in North America
   and focused on the bacterial microbiome of amphibians infected by the
   chytrid fungus. Despite mentioning pathogen inhibition by the skin
   microbiome, only 30.4\% of studies experimentally tested the actual
   antimicrobial activity of symbionts. Additionally, only 7.8\% of all
   publications studied defensive cutaneous symbionts during hibernation.
   With this review, we want to highlight the knowledge gap surrounding
   skin microbiome research in hibernating animals. For instance, research
   looking to mitigate the effects of white-nose syndrome in bats should
   focus on the antifungal microbiome of Palearctic bats, as they survive
   exposure to the Pseudogymnoascus destructans -pathogen during
   hibernation. We also recommend future studies prioritize lesser-known
   microbial symbionts, such as fungi, and investigate the effects of a
   combination of anti-pathogen microbes, as both areas of research show
   promise as probiotic treatments. By incorporating the protective skin
   microbiome into disease mitigation strategies, conservation efforts can
   be made more effective.},

	abstract = {Skin is an important ecosystem that links the human body and the
   external environment. Previous studies have shown that the skin
   microbial community could remain stable, even after long-term exposure
   to the external environment. In this study, we explore two questions: Do
   there exist strains or genetic variants in skin microorganisms that are
   individual-specific, temporally stable, and body site-independent? And
   if so, whether such microorganismal genetic variants could be used as
   markers, called ``fingerprints{''} in our study, to identify donors? We
   proposed a framework to capture individual-specific DNA microbial
   fingerprints from skin metagenomic sequencing data. The fingerprints are
   identified on the frequency of 31-mers free from reference genomes and
   sequence alignments. The 616 metagenomic samples from 17 skin sites at
   3-time points from 12 healthy individuals from Integrative Human
   Microbiome Project were adopted. Ultimately, one contig for each
   individual is assembled as a fingerprint. And results showed that
   89.78\% of the skin samples despite body sites could identify their
   donors correctly. It is observed that 10 out of 12 individual-specific
   fingerprints could be aligned to Cutibacterium acnes. Our study proves
   that the identified fingerprints are temporally stable, body
   site-independent, and individual-specific, and can identify their donors

	abstract = {The microhylid frogs of the New Guinea region are the largest and most ecologically diverse subfamily (Asterophryinae) of one of the largest anuran families in the world and can live in communities of up to 20 species. While there has been recent progress in resolving the phylogenetic relationships of Asterophryinae, significant uncertainties remain, impeding further progress in understanding the evolution of microhabitat use, parental care, and life history variation in this group. In particular, the early divergences at the base of the tree remain unclear; as does the monophyly of some genera; and recent studies have discovered that species with wide geographic distribution are instead cryptic species complexes. In this study, we fortified geographic sampling of the largest previous phylogenetic effort by sequencing an additional 62 taxa and increased data quality and quantity by adding new layers of data vetting and by filling in previously incomplete loci to the five gene dataset (2 mitochondrial, 3 nuclear protein-coding genes) to obtain a dataset that is now 99% complete in over 2400 characters for 233 samples (205 taxa) of Asterophryinae and 3 outgroup taxa, and analyzed microhabitat use data for these taxa from field data and data collected from the literature. Importantly, our sampling includes complete community complements at 19 sites as well as representatives at over 80 sites across New Guinea and its offshore islands. We present a highly resolved molecular phylogeny which, for the first time, has over 95% of nodes supported (84% highly supported) whether using Maximum Likelihood or Bayesian Inference, allowing clarification of all genera (whether monophyletic or clearly not), their sister genera relationships, as well as an age estimate for the Asterophryinae at approximately 20MYA. Early generic diversification occurring between 17 and 12 MYA gave rise to a surprising diversity of about 18 genera as well as the 5 putative microhabitat types. Our tree reveals extensive cryptic diversity calling any widespread taxa into doubt, and clearly demonstrates that complex multispecies communities of Asterophryinae are ecologically diverse, are numerous, and of ancient origin across New Guinea. We discuss the implications of our phylogeny for explaining the explosive diversification of Asterophryinae as the result of adaptive radiation, niche conservatism, and non-adaptive radiation.},

	abstract = {Background DNA barcodes are a useful tool for discovering,
   understanding, and monitoring biodiversity which are critical tasks at a
   time of rapid biodiversity loss. However, widespread adoption of
   barcodes requires cost-effective and simple barcoding methods. We here
   present a workflow that satisfies these conditions. It was developed via
   ``innovation through subtraction{''} and thus requires minimal lab
   equipment, can be learned within days, reduces the barcode sequencing
   cost to < 10 cents, and allows fast turnaround from specimen to sequence
   by using the portable MinION sequencer. Results We describe how tagged
   amplicons can be obtained and sequenced with the real-time MinION
   sequencer in many settings (field stations, biodiversity labs, citizen
   science labs, schools). We also provide amplicon coverage
   recommendations that are based on several runs of the latest generation
   of MinION flow cells ({''}R10.3{''}) which suggest that each run can
   generate barcodes for > 10,000 specimens. Next, we present a novel
   software, ONTbarcoder, which overcomes the bioinformatics challenges
   posed by MinION reads. The software is compatible with Windows 10,
   Macintosh, and Linux, has a graphical user interface (GUI), and can
   generate thousands of barcodes on a standard laptop within hours based
   on only two input files (FASTQ, demultiplexing file). We document that
   MinION barcodes are virtually identical to Sanger and Illumina barcodes
   for the same specimens (> 99.99\%) and provide evidence that MinION flow
   cells and reads have improved rapidly since 2018. Conclusions We propose
   that barcoding with MinION is the way forward for government agencies,
   universities, museums, and schools because it combines low consumable
   and capital cost with scalability. Small projects can use the flow cell
   dongle ({''}Flongle{''}) while large projects can rely on MinION flow
   cells that can be stopped and re-used after collecting sufficient data
   for a given project.},

   and large-scale biodiversity discovery, but remains underutilized for

   low-cost MinION sequencers. We demonstrate the power of the approach by
   generating 250 barcodes for 285 specimens within 6 h including specimen
   identification through BLAST. The workflow required only the following
   major equipment that easily fits onto a lab bench: Thermocycler,
   NextGenPCR, microplate sealer, Qubit, and MinION. Based on our results,

	abstract = {Amphibians host a community of microbes on their skin that helps resist
   infectious disease via the dual influence of anti-pathogenic microbial
   species and emergent community dynamics. Many frogs rely on freshwater
   habitats, but salinization is rapidly increasing saltwater
   concentrations in wetlands around the globe, increasing the likelihood
   that frogs will come into contact with salt-contaminated habitats.
   Currently, we know little about how increased salt exposure will affect
   the symbiotic relationship between the skin microbes and frog hosts. To
   better understand how salt exposure in a natural context affects the
   frog skin microbiome, we use Hyla cinerea, a North American treefrog
   species that can inhabit brackish wetlands, to explore three questions.
   First, we determine the extent that microbial communities in the
   environment and on frog skin are similar across populations. Second, we
   assess the microbial species richness and relative abundance on frogs
   from habitats with different salinity levels to determine how salinity
   affects the microbiome. Third, we test whether the relative abundances
   of putatively pathogen-resistant bacterial species differ between frogs
   from inland and coastal environments. We found that the frog microbiome
   is more similar among frogs than to the microbial communities found in
   surface water and soil, but there is overlap between frog skin and the
   environmental samples. Skin microbial community richness did not differ
   among populations, but the relative abundances of microbes were
   different across populations and salinities. We found no differences in
   the relative abundances of the anti-fungal bacteria Janthinobacterium
   lividum, the genus Pseudomonas, and Serratia marcescens, suggesting that
   environmental exposure to saltwater has a limited influence on these
   putatively beneficial bacterial taxa.},

	abstract = {The host-associated microbiome plays a significant role in health.
   However, the roles of factors such as host genetics and microbial
   interactions in determining microbiome diversity remain unclear. We
   examined these factors using amplicon-based sequencing of 175 Thoropa
   taophora frog skin swabs collected from a naturally fragmented landscape
   in southeastern Brazil. Specifically, we examined (1) the effects of
   geography and host genetics on microbiome diversity and structure; (2)
   the structure of microbial eukaryotic and bacterial co-occurrence
   networks; and (3) co-occurrence between microeukaryotes with bacterial
   OTUs known to affect growth of the fungal pathogen Batrachochytrium
   dendrobatidis (Bd). While bacterial alpha diversity varied by both site
   type and host MHC IIB genotype, microeukaryotic alpha diversity varied
   only by site type. However, bacteria and microeukaryote composition
   showed variation according to both site type and host MHC IIB genotype.
   Our network analysis showed the highest connectivity when both
   eukaryotes and bacteria were included, implying that ecological
   interactions may occur among domains. Lastly, anti-Bd bacteria were not
   broadly negatively co-associated with the fungal microbiome and were
   positively associated with potential amphibian parasites. Our findings
   emphasize the importance of considering both domains in microbiome
   research and suggest that for effective probiotic strategies for
   amphibian disease management, considering potential interactions among
   all members of the microbiome is crucial.},

@article{Belden:2015,
	abstract = {Vertebrates, including amphibians, host diverse symbiotic microbes that
   contribute to host disease resistance. Globally, and especially in
   montane tropical systems, many amphibian species are threatened by a
   chytrid fungus, Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis (Bd), that causes a
   lethal skin disease. Bd therefore may be a strong selective agent on the
   diversity and function of the microbial communities inhabiting amphibian
   skin. In Panama, amphibian population declines and the spread of Bd have
   been tracked. In 2012, we completed a field survey in Panama to examine
   frog skin microbiota in the context of Bd infection. We focused on three
   frog species and collected two skin swabs per frog from a total of 136
   frogs across four sites that varied from west to east in the time since
   Bd arrival. One swab was used to assess bacterial community structure
   using 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing and to determine Bd infection status,
   and one was used to assess metabolite diversity, as the bacterial
   production of anti fungal metabolites is an important disease resistance
   function. The skin microbiota of the three Panamanian frog species
   differed in OTU (operational taxonomic unit, bacterial species)
   community composition and metabolite profiles, although the pattern was
   less strong for the metabolites. Comparisons between frog skin bacterial
   communities from Panama and the US suggest broad similarities at the
   phylum level, but key differences at lower taxonomic levels. In our
   field survey in Panama, across all four sites, only 35 individuals
   (similar to 26\%) were Bd infected. There was no clustering of OTUs or
   metabolite profiles based on Bd infection status and no clear pattern of
   west east changes in OTUs or metabolite profiles across the four sites.
   Overall, our field survey data suggest that different bacterial
   communities might be producing broadly similar sets of metabolites
   across frog hosts and sites. Community structure and function may not be
   as tightly coupled in these skin symbiont microbial systems as it is in
   many macro systems.},

   the association between bacterial diversity and composition and the
   major histocompatibility complex class II exon 2 diversity in 12 moor

   considerably depending on geography and evolutionary history. Bacterial
   alpha diversity was positively correlated with expected MHC
   heterozygosity and negatively with MHC nucleotide diversity.
   Furthermore, bacterial community composition showed significant
   variation between the two geographical clusters and between specific MHC

   microbiome of Pelophylax perezi frog by looking for variations between
   populations in reference and under stress conditions (one metal
   contaminated and another with salinity fluctuations) and ii) evaluate
   the tolerance of skin-isolated bacteria to chemical contamination. Skin
   swabs were collected from frog populations inhabiting three reference
   sites (LB, VA and AM), one metal-rich contaminated (TP) and one brackish
   lentic aquatic system (SL). The frogs' skin microbiome was characterized
   by culture independent method (DGGE) and by cultivation methods. DGGE
   showed a characteristic profile in frogs from TP population. Results of
   recovered communities revealed low morphotype diversity and density
   (Colony Forming Units per frog) on individuals from TP population,
   comparatively to the other sampled populations. Isolated bacteria
   identified based on 16S rRNA gene sequence belong mainly to the classes
   Actinobacteria and Alphaproteobacteria. Ecotoxicological assays with
   acid-metal contaminated effluent (ETP) showed that the percentage of
   tolerant strains was higher in frogs from TP population than in SL and
   LB populations. In conclusion, results suggest that: a) environmental
   specific characteristics, as the presence of chemical contaminants,
   influence the composition of amphibian microbiome, comparing with sites
   without such contaminants; b) there are differences in microbiome
   composition between populations; and c) bacteria historically exposed to
   effluent may evolve tolerance to this kind of contamination. (C) 2016

	abstract = {While a number of amphibian skin microbiomes have been characterized, it
   is unclear how these communities might vary in response to seasonal
   changes in the environment and the corresponding behaviors that many
   amphibians exhibit. Given recent studies demonstrating the importance of
   the skin microbiome in frog innate immune defense against pathogens,
   investigating how changes in the environment impact the microbial
   species present will provide a better understanding of conditions that
   may alter host susceptibility to pathogens in their environment. We
   sampled the bacterial skin microbiome of North American wood frogs (Rana
   sylvatica) from two breeding ponds in the spring, along with the
   bacterial community present in their vernal breeding pools, and frogs
   from the nearby forest floor in the summer and fall to determine whether
   community composition differs by sex, vernal pond site, or temporally
   across season (spring, summer, fall). Taxon relative abundance data
   reveals a profile of bacterial phyla similar to those previously
   described on anuran skin, with Proteobacteria, Bacteroidetes, and
   Actinobacteria dominating the wood frog skin microbiome. Our results
   indicate that sex had no significant effect on skin microbiota
   diversity; however, this may be due to our limited female frog sample
   size. Vernal pool site had a small but significant effect on skin
   microbiota, but skin-associated communities were more similar to each
   other than to the communities observed in the frogs' respective pond
   water. Across seasons, diversity analyses suggest that there are
   significant differences between the bacterial skin microbiome of frogs
   from spring and summer/fall groups while the average alpha-diversity per
   frog remained consistent. These results illustrate seasonal variation in
   wood frog skin microbiome structure and highlight the importance of
   considering temporal trends in an amphibian microbiome, particularly for
   species whose life history requires recurrent shifts in habitat and
   behavior.},

   role in organismal health across a wide range of hosts. Amphibians are
   unique hosts in that their skin helps to regulate the exchange of water,

   poorly understood. We collected skin swabs from montane amphibians in
   Mexico and Guatemala, focusing on two genera of plethodontid salamanders
   and one genus of frogs. We used high throughput sequencing to
   characterize the skin bacterial microbiome and tested the impact of
   phylogeny and habitat on bacterial diversity. Our results show that
   phylogenetic history strongly influences the diversity and community
   structure of the total bacterial microbiome at higher taxonomic levels

   global panzootic among amphibians. However, the mechanisms driving
   community structure and function in the amphibian skin microbiome are

   the course of 2 years. We found that individuals with low bacterial
   diversity (dominated by order Burkhorderiales) had significantly more
   stable bacterial communities than those with higher diversity. Amplicon
   sequence variants (ASVs) with high relative abundance were significantly
   less transient than those with low relative abundance, and ASVs with
   intermediate-level relative abundances experienced the greatest
   volatility over time. Based on these results, we suggest that efforts to

   understand how host and environmental factors shape these communities

   bacterial communities differ among host species, host infection status,
   host developmental stage, and host habitat. We collected skin swabs from
   tadpoles and adults of three Ranid frog species (Lithobates spp.) at the
   Mianus River Gorge Preserve in Bedford, New York, USA, and used 16S rRNA
   gene amplicon sequencing to determine bacterial community composition.
   Our analysis suggests amphibian skin bacterial communities change across
   host developmental stages, as has been documented previously.
   Additionally, we found that skin bacterial communities differed among
   Ranid species, with skin communities on the host species captured in
   streams or bogs differing from the communities of the species captured
   on land. Thus, habitat use of different species may drive differences in

   diseases. However, the effects of environmental and host factors on
   symbiotic bacterial communities are not well understood. Caribbean frogs
   in the genus Eleutherodactylus represent a case of congeneric species
   that differ in ecological specialization by the process of adaptive
   radiation. For a small clade of Eleutherodactylus from Puerto Rico, we
   investigated the role of local environments, host species, and
   microhabitat in the composition of their skin microbiome. The potential
   congruence between microbial communities in hosts that are most closely
   related phylogenetically was also addressed. We hypothesized that the
   skin microbiota of Eleutherodactylus frogs would be mostly associated to
   microhabitat use, but also differ according to locality, and to a lesser
   extent to host species. To test this hypothesis, we swabbed the skin of
   a total of 98 adult individuals of seven Eleutherodactylus species
   distributed in two nearby localities in Puerto Rico, and sequenced the
   V4 region of the 16S rRNA gene. Results showed that locality had the
   greatest effect on determining skin bacterial communities of amphibian
   hosts, but this effect was stronger on the composition (based on
   presence/absence) than on its structure (based on sequence abundance).
   The most ecologically distinct host, E. cooki, and the generalist E.
   coqui presented, respectively, the most dissimilar and similar
   microbiota compared to other hosts. Host phylogeny showed a weak
   influence on skin microbiota. Results suggest that both local

	abstract = {Host-associated microbial communities are ubiquitous among animals, and
   serve important functions. For example, the bacterial skin microbiome of
   amphibians can play a role in preventing or reducing infection by the
   amphibian chytrid fungus, Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis. Evidence
   suggests that environmental bacteria likely serve as a source pool for
   at least some of the members of the amphibian skin bacterial community,
   underscoring the potential for local environmental changes to disrupt
   microbial community source pools that could be critical to the health of
   host organisms. However, few studies have assessed variation in the
   amphibian skin microbiome along clear environmental gradients, and so we
   know relatively little about how local environmental conditions
   influence microbiome diversity. We sampled the skin bacterial
   communities of Coqui frogs, Eleutherodactylus coqui (N = 77), along an
   elevational gradient in eastern Puerto Rico (0 -875 m), with transects
   in two land use types: intact forest (N = 4 sites) and disturbed (N = 3
   sites) forest. We found that alpha diversity (as assessed by Shannon,
   Simpson, and Phylogenetic Diversity indices) varied across sites, but
   this variation was not correlated with elevation or land use. Beta
   diversity (community structure), on the other hand, varied with site,
   elevation and land use, primarily due to changes in the relative
   abundance of certain bacterial OTUs (similar to species) within these
   communities. Importantly, although microbiome diversity varied, E. coqui
   maintained a common core microbiota across all sites. Thus, our findings
   suggest that environmental conditions can influence the composition of
   the skin microbiome of terrestrial amphibians, but that some aspects of
   the microbiome remain consistent despite environmental variation.},

   drives variation in the composition of these complex communities
   continues to grow. Microbiome studies at larger spatial scales present
   opportunities to evaluate the contribution of large-scale factors to
   variation in the microbiome. We conducted a large-scale field study to
   assess variation in the bacterial symbiont communities on adult frog
   skin (Pseudacris crucifer), characterized using 16S rRNA gene amplicon
   sequencing. We found that skin bacterial communities on frogs were less
   diverse than, and structurally distinct from, the surrounding habitat.
   Frog skin was typically dominated by one of two bacterial OTUs: at
   western sites, a Proteobacteria dominated the community, whereas eastern
   sites were dominated by an Actinobacteria. Using a metacommunity
   framework, we then sought to identify factors explaining small- and
   large-scale variation in community structure-that is, among hosts within
   a pond, and among ponds spanning the study transect. We focused on the
   presence of a fungal skin pathogen, Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis (Bd)
   as one potential driver of variation. We found no direct link between
   skin bacterial community structure and Bd infection status of individual
   frog hosts. Differences in pond-level community structure, however, were
   explained by Bd infection prevalence. Importantly, Bd infection
   prevalence itself was correlated with numerous other environmental
   factors; thus, skin bacterial diversity may be influenced by a complex
   suite of extrinsic factors. Our findings indicate that large-scale
   factors and processes merit consideration when seeking to understand

@article{Jani:2018,
	abstract = {Symbiotic microbial communities play key roles in the health and
   development of their multicellular hosts. Understanding why microbial
   communities vary among different host species or individuals is an
   important step toward understanding the diversity and function of the
   microbiome. The amphibian skin microbiome may affect resistance to the
   fungal pathogen Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis (Bd). Still, the factors
   that determine the diversity and composition of the amphibian skin
   microbiome, and therefore may ultimately contribute to disease
   resistance, are not well understood. We conducted a two-phase experiment
   to first test how host and environment shape the amphibian skin
   microbiome, and then test if the microbiome affects or is affected by Bd
   infection. Most lab experiments testing assembly of the amphibian skin
   microbiome so far have compared sterile to non-sterile environments or
   heavily augmented to non-augmented frogs. A goal of this study was to
   evaluate, in an experimental setting, realistic potential drivers of
   microbiome assembly that would be relevant to patterns observed in
   nature. We tested effects of frog genetic background (2 source
   populations) and 6 natural lake water sources in shaping the microbiome
   of the frog Rana sierrae. Water in which frogs were housed affected the
   microbiome in a manner that partially mimicked patterns observed in
   natural populations. In particular, frogs housed in water from
   disease-resistant populations had greater bacterial richness than frogs
   housed in water from populations that died out due to Bd. However, in
   the experiment this difference in microbiomes did not lead to
   differences in host mortality or rates of pathogen load increase. Frog
   source population also affected the microbiome and, although none of the
   frogs in this study showed true resistance to infection, host source
   population had a small effect on the rate of pathogen load increase.
   This difference in infection trajectories could be due to the observed
   differences in the microbiome, but could also be due to other traits
   that differ between frogs from the two populations. In addition to
   examining effects of the microbiome on Bd, we tested the effect of Bd
   infection severity on the microbiome. Specifically, we studied a time
   series of the microbiome over the course of infection to test if the
   effects of Bd on the microbiome are dependent on Bd infection severity.
   Although limited to a small subset of frogs, time series analysis
   suggested that relative abundances of several bacterial phylotypes
   changed as Bd loads increased through time, indicating that Bd-induced
   disturbance of the R. sierrae microbiome is not a binary effect but
   instead is dependent on infection severity. We conclude that both host
   and aquatic environment help shape the R. sierrae skin microbiome, with
   links to small changes in disease resistance in some cases, but in this
   study the effect of Bd on the microbiome was greater than the effect of
   the microbiome on Bd. Assessment of the microbiome differences between
   more distantly related populations than those studied here is needed to
   fully understand the role of the microbiome in resistance to Bd.},

	abstract = {Background The skin microbiome serves as a first line defense against
   pathogens in vertebrates. In amphibians, it has the potential to protect
   against the chytrid fungusBatrachochytrium dendrobatis(Bd), a likely
   agent of amphibian declines. Alteration of the microbiome associated
   with unfavorable environmental changes produced by anthropogenic
   activities may make the host more susceptible to pathogens. Some
   amphibian species that were thought to be ``extinct{''} have been
   rediscovered years after population declines in the late 1980s probably
   due to evolvedBd-resistance and are now threatened by anthropogenic
   land-use changes. Understanding the effects of habitat disturbance on
   the host skin microbiome is relevant for understanding the health of
   these species, along with its susceptibility to pathogens such asBd.
   Here, we investigate the influence of habitat alteration on the skin
   bacterial communities as well as specifically the putativeBd-inhibitory
   bacterial communities of the montane frogLithobates vibicarius. This
   species, after years of not being observed, was rediscovered in small
   populations inhabiting undisturbed and disturbed landscapes, and with
   continuous presence ofBd. Results We found that cutaneous bacterial
   communities of tadpoles and adults differed between undisturbed and
   disturbed habitats. The adults from disturbed habitats exhibited greater
   community dispersion than those from undisturbed habitats. We observed a
   higher richness of putativeBd-inhibitory bacterial strains in adults
   from disturbed habitats than in those from undisturbed habitats, as well
   as a greater number of these potential protective bacteria with a high
   relative abundance. Conclusions Our findings support the microbial
   ``Anna Karenina principle{''}, in which disturbance is hypothesized to
   cause greater microbial dispersion in communities, a so-called
   dysbiosis, which is a response of animal microbiomes to stress factors
   that decrease the ability of the host or its microbiome to regulate
   community composition. On the positive side, the high richness and
   relative abundance of putativeBd-inhibitory bacteria may indicate the
   development of a defense mechanism that enhancesBd-protection,
   attributed to a co-occurrence of more than 30-years of host and pathogen
   in these disturbed habitats. Our results provide important insight into
   the influence of human-modified landscapes on the skin microbiome and
   health implications ofBd-survivor species.},

   microbiome has gained importance with the spread ofBatrachochytrium
   dendrobatidis(Bd), the fungal pathogen that can cause the skin disease
   chytridiomycosis. Sampling amphibian skin microbiota is needed to
   characterize current infection status and to help predict future
   susceptibility to Bd based on microbial composition since some skin
   microbes have antifungal capabilities that may confer disease
   resistance. Here, I use 16S rRNA sequencing to describe the composition
   and structure of the cutaneous microbiota of six species of amphibians.
   Frog skin samples were also tested for Bd, and I found 11.8\% Bd
   prevalence among all individuals sampled (n= 76). Frog skin microbiota
   varied by host species and sampling site, but did not differ among
   Bd-positive and Bd-negative individuals. These results suggest that
   bacterial composition reflects host species and the environment, but
   does not reflect Bd infection among the species sampled here. Of the
   bacterial OTUs identified using an indicator species analysis as
   strongly associated with amphibians, significantly more indicator OTUs
   were putative anti-Bd taxa than would be expected based on the
   proportion of anti-Bd OTUs among all frog OTUs, suggesting strong
   associations between host species and anti-Bd OTUs. This relationship
   may partially explain why some of these frogs are asymptomatic carriers
   of Bd, but more work is needed to determine the other factors that
   contribute to interspecific variation in Bd susceptibility. This work
   provides important insights on inter- and intra-specific variation in
   microbial community composition, putative function, and disease dynamics
   in populations of amphibians that appear to be coexisting with Bd.},

	abstract = {Background The amphibian skin microbiome is an important mediator of
   host health and serves as a potential source of undiscovered
   scientifically significant compounds. However, the underlying modalities
   of how amphibian hosts obtain their initial skin-associated microbiome
   remains unclear. Here, we explore microbial transmission patterns in
   foam-nest breeding tree frogs from Southeast Asia (Genus: Polypedates)
   whose specialized breeding strategy allows for better delineation
   between vertically and environmentally derived microbes. To facilitate
   this, we analyzed samples associated with adult frog pairs taken after
   mating-including adults of each sex, their foam nests, environments, and
   tadpoles before and after environmental interaction-for the bacterial
   communities using DNA metabarcoding data (16S rRNA). Samples were
   collected from frogs in-situ in Brunei, Borneo, a previously unsampled
   region for amphibian-related microbial diversity. Results Adult frogs
   differed in skin bacterial communities among species, but tadpoles did
   not differ among species. Foam nests had varying bacterial community
   composition, most notably in the nests' moist interior. Nest interior
   bacterial communities were discrete for each nest and overall displayed
   a narrower diversity compared to the nest exteriors. Tadpoles sampled
   directly from the foam nest displayed a bacterial composition less like
   the nest interior and more similar to that of the adults and nest
   exterior. After one week of pond water interaction the tadpole skin
   microbiome shifted towards the tadpole skin and pond water microbial
   communities being more tightly coupled than between tadpoles and the
   internal nest environment, but not to the extent that the skin
   microbiome mirrored the pond bacterial community. Conclusions Both
   vertical influence and environmental interaction play a role in shaping
   the tadpole cutaneous microbiome. Interestingly, the interior of the
   foam nest had a distinct bacterial community from the tadpoles
   suggesting a limited environmental effect on tadpole cutaneous bacterial
   selection at initial stages of life. The shift in the tadpole microbiome
   after environmental interaction indicates an interplay between
   underlying host and ecological mechanisms that drive community
   formation. This survey serves as a baseline for further research into
   the ecology of microbial transmission in aquatic animals.},

	abstract = {Skin symbiotic bacteria on amphibians can play a role in protecting
   their host against pathogens. Chytridiomycosis, the disease caused by
   Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis, Bd, has caused dramatic population
   declines and extinctions of amphibians worldwide. Anti-Bd bacteria from
   amphibian skin have been cultured, and skin bacterial communities have
   been described through 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing. Here, we
   present a shotgun metagenomic analysis of skin bacterial communities
   from a Neotropical frog, Craugastor fitzingeri. We sequenced the
   metagenome of six frogs from two different sites in Panama: three frogs
   from Soberania (Sob), a Bd-endemic site, and three frogs from Serrania
   del Sapo (Sapo), a Bd-naive site. We described the taxonomic composition
   of skin microbiomes and found that Pseudomonas was a major component of
   these communities. We also identified that Sob communities were enriched
   in Actinobacteria while Sapo communities were enriched in
   Gammaproteobacteria. We described gene abundances within the main
   functional classes and found genes enriched either in Sapo or Sob. We
   then focused our study on five functional classes of genes: biosynthesis
   of secondary metabolites, metabolism of terpenoids and polyketides,
   membrane transport, cellular communication and antimicrobial drug
   resistance. These gene classes are potentially involved in bacterial
   communication, bacterial-host and bacterial-pathogen interactions among
   other functions. We found that C. fitzingeri metagenomes have a wide
   array of genes that code for secondary metabolites, including
   antibiotics and bacterial toxins, which may be involved in bacterial
   communication, but could also have a defensive role against pathogens.
   Several genes involved in bacterial communication and bacterial-host
   interactions, such as biofilm formation and bacterial secretion systems
   were found. We identified specific genes and pathways enriched at the
   different sites and determined that gene co-occurrence networks differed
   between sites. Our results suggest that skin microbiomes are composed of
   distinct bacterial taxa with a wide range of metabolic capabilities
   involved in bacterial defense and communication. Differences in
   taxonomic composition and pathway enrichments suggest that skin
   microbiomes from different sites have unique functional properties. This
   study strongly supports the need for shotgun metagenomic analyses to
   describe the functional capacities of skin microbiomes and to tease
   apart their role in host defense against pathogens.},

	abstract = {The composition and dynamics of the skin bacterial and fungal microbiome
   is thought to influence host-pathogen defence. This microbial community
   is shaped by host captivity, diet, and microbial interactions between
   bacterial and fungal components. However, there remains little
   understanding of how specific micronutrients influence bacterial and
   fungal microbiome composition and their inter-domain interactions during
   rewilding of captive-bred animals. This study experimentally
   investigated the effect of dietary beta-carotene supplementation and
   subsequent field release on bacterial and fungal microbiome composition
   and dynamics using the Southern Corroboree frog (Pseudophryne
   corroboree) as a model system. We found large-scale diversification of
   bacterial communities post-release and similar diversification of fungal
   communities. The rewilded fungal mycobiome was more transient and
   demonstrated stronger temporal and micro-spatial fluctuations than the
   bacterial microbiome. Accounting for temporal and spatial factors, we
   found strong residual associations between bacterial members, yet
   limited evidence for inter-domain associations, suggesting that
   co-occurrence patterns between bacterial and fungal communities are
   largely a result of shared responses to the environment rather than
   direct interactions. Lastly, we found supplementation of dietary
   beta-carotene in captivity had no impact on post-release microbiome
   diversity, yet was associated with approximately 15\% of common
   bacterial and fungal genera. Our research demonstrates that
   environmental factors play a dominant role over dietary beta-carotene
   supplementation in shaping microbiome diversity post-release, and
   suggest inter-domain interactions may also only exert a minor influence.
   Further research on the function and ecology of skin bacterial and
   fungal microbiomes will be crucial for developing strategies to support
   survival of endangered amphibian species.},

	abstract = {Research on the amphibian skin microbiota has focused on identifying
   bacterial taxa that deter a pathogenic chytrid fungus, and on describing
   patterns of microbiota variation. However, it remains unclear how
   environmental variation affects amphibian skin bacterial communities,
   and whether the overall functional diversity of the amphibian skin
   microbiota is associated to such variation. We sampled skin microbial
   communities from one dendrobatoid frog species across an environmental
   gradient along the Panama Canal, and from three dendrobatoid frog
   species before and after the onset of the wet season in one site. We
   found frog skin microbial alpha diversity to be highest in frogs from
   sites with low soil pH, but no clear effect of the onset of the wet
   season. However, we found frog skin microbial community structure to be
   affected by soil pH and the onset of the wet season, which also resulted
   in a decrease in between-sample variation. Across the sampled frog
   species, bacterial functional groups changed with the onset of the wet
   season, with certain bacterial functional groups entirely disappearing
   and others differing in their relative abundances. In particular, we
   found the proportion of Bd-inhibitory bacteria to correlate with mean
   soil pH, and to increase in two of the frog species with the onset of
   the wet season. Taken together, our results suggest that structure and
   predicted function of amphibian bacterial skin communities may be
   influenced by environmental variables such as pH and precipitation, site
   effects, and host effects.},

   Core bacteria on the three lizard species overlapped by over 100

   within species of frogs and lizards, but the communities tended to be
   more similar between lizard species than between frog species and when

@article{Ramesh2017,
	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Formalin is widely used to fix histological preparations and as preservatives in embalming solutions and is an age-long practice in medical laboratories. It is generally accepted that the risk of contracting infections is relatively high among medical laboratory workers and pathologists. Recent studies have, however, suggested that formalin does not effectively inactivate all kinds of microbes in formalin-fixed tissue (FFT). Long time preserved tissues in formalin may develop growth of microbes on the surface of the formalin. AIMS AND OBJECTIVES: The purpose of the study is to determine the growth of microorganisms on the surface of FFTs. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Fifty-one containers of 10% formalin with fixed tissues and undiscarded formalin solution not containing tissues of years 2013-2015 (17 in each year) were selected, and samples for inoculation onto the cysteine lactose electrolyte deficient agar plates were taken from the surface of the FFT using sterile cotton tips. The growth of the colonies was checked for after 48 h. RESULTS: Out of 51 samples from 2013 to 2015, 17 had shown growth of microbial colonies. Six out of 17 samples of 2013, 7 out of 17 of 2014 and 4 out of 17 samples of 2015 had colonies of microbes on agar plates. Gram-negative bacilli, Bacillus subtilis and micrococci were mostly found. CONCLUSION: There were viable microbes on the surfaces of formalin solution containing pathology tissue. Since cross-contamination by microbes may occur during regrossing or processing, protocols to decrease cross-contamination should be instituted.},

@article{Tin2014,
	abstract = {Ancient and archival DNA samples are valuable resources for the study of diverse historical processes. In particular, museum specimens provide access to biotas distant in time and space, and can provide insights into ecological and evolutionary changes over time. However, archival specimens are difficult to handle; they are often fragile and irreplaceable, and typically contain only short segments of denatured DNA. Here we present a set of tools for processing such samples for state-of-the-art genetic analysis. First, we report a protocol for minimally destructive DNA extraction of insect museum specimens, which produced sequenceable DNA from all of the samples assayed. The 11 specimens analyzed had fragmented DNA, rarely exceeding 100 bp in length, and could not be amplified by conventional PCR targeting the mitochondrial cytochrome oxidase I gene. Our approach made these samples amenable to analysis with commonly used next-generation sequencing-based molecular analytic tools, including RAD-tagging and shotgun genome re-sequencing. First, we used museum ant specimens from three species, each with its own reference genome, for RAD-tag mapping. Were able to use the degraded DNA sequences, which were sequenced in full, to identify duplicate reads and filter them prior to base calling. Second, we re-sequenced six Hawaiian Drosophila species, with millions of years of divergence, but with only a single available reference genome. Despite a shallow coverage of 0.37 $\pm$ 0.42 per base, we could recover a sufficient number of overlapping SNPs to fully resolve the species tree, which was consistent with earlier karyotypic studies, and previous molecular studies, at least in the regions of the tree that these studies could resolve. Although developed for use with degraded DNA, all of these techniques are readily applicable to more recent tissue, and are suitable for liquid handling automation.},

What made these DNA sequences exceptional was that they were derived from 140- and 2400-year-old specimens. However, ancient DNA research, defined broadly as the retrieval of DNA sequences from museum specimens, archaeological finds, fossil remains, and other unusual sources of DNA, only really became feasible with the advent of techniques for the enzymatic amplification of specific DNA sequences. Today, reports of analyses of specimens hundreds, thousands, and even millions of years old are almost commonplace. But can all these results be believed?

	abstract = {Museums and other natural history collections (NHC) worldwide house millions of specimens. With the advent of molecular genetic approaches these collections have become the source of many fascinating population studies in conservation genetics that contrast historical with present-day genetic diversity. Recent developments in molecular genetics and genomics and the associated statistical tools have opened up the further possibility of studying evolutionary change directly. As we discuss here, we believe that NHC specimens provide a largely underutilized resource for such investigations. However, because DNA extracted from NHC samples is degraded, analyses of such samples are technically demanding and many potential pitfalls exist. Thus, we propose a set of guidelines that outline the steps necessary to begin genetic investigations using specimens from NHC.},

@article{Staats2013,
	abstract = {Unlocking the vast genomic diversity stored in natural history collections would create unprecedented opportunities for genome-scale evolutionary, phylogenetic, domestication and population genomic studies. Many researchers have been discouraged from using historical specimens in molecular studies because of both generally limited success of DNA extraction and the challenges associated with PCR-amplifying highly degraded DNA. In today's next-generation sequencing (NGS) world, opportunities and prospects for historical DNA have changed dramatically, as most NGS methods are actually designed for taking short fragmented DNA molecules as templates. Here we show that using a standard multiplex and paired-end Illumina sequencing approach, genome-scale sequence data can be generated reliably from dry-preserved plant, fungal and insect specimens collected up to 115 years ago, and with minimal destructive sampling. Using a reference-based assembly approach, we were able to produce the entire nuclear genome of a 43-year-old Arabidopsis thaliana (Brassicaceae) herbarium specimen with high and uniform sequence coverage. Nuclear genome sequences of three fungal specimens of 22--82 years of age (Agaricus bisporus, Laccaria bicolor, Pleurotus ostreatus) were generated with 81.4--97.9% exome coverage. Complete organellar genome sequences were assembled for all specimens. Using de novo assembly we retrieved between 16.2--71.0% of coding sequence regions, and hence remain somewhat cautious about prospects for de novo genome assembly from historical specimens. Non-target sequence contaminations were observed in 2 of our insect museum specimens. We anticipate that future museum genomics projects will perhaps not generate entire genome sequences in all cases (our specimens contained relatively small and low-complexity genomes), but at least generating vital comparative genomic data for testing (phylo)genetic, demographic and genetic hypotheses, that become increasingly more horizontal. Furthermore, NGS of historical DNA enables recovering crucial genetic information from old type specimens that to date have remained mostly unutilized and, thus, opens up a new frontier for taxonomic research as well.},

@article{Sampaio2023,
	abstract = {Uropeltidae is a clade of small fossorial snakes (ca. 64 extant species) endemic to peninsular India and Sri Lanka. Uropeltid taxonomy has been confusing, and the status of some species has not been revised for over a century. Attempts to revise uropeltid systematics and undertake evolutionary studies have been hampered by incompletely sampled and incompletely resolved phylogenies. To address this issue, we take advantage of historical museum collections, including type specimens, and apply genome-wide shotgun (GWS) sequencing, along with recent field sampling (using Sanger sequencing) to establish a near-complete multilocus species-level phylogeny (ca. 87% complete at species level). This results in a phylogeny that supports the monophyly of all genera (if Brachyophidium is considered a junior synonym of Teretrurus), and provides a firm platform for future taxonomic revision. Sri Lankan uropeltids are probably monophyletic, indicating a single colonisation event of this island from Indian ancestors. However, the position of Rhinophis goweri (endemic to Eastern Ghats, southern India) is unclear and warrants further investigation, and evidence that it may nest within the Sri Lankan radiation indicates a possible recolonisation event. DNA sequence data and morphology suggest that currently recognised uropeltid species diversity is substantially underestimated. Our study highlights the benefits of integrating museum collections in molecular genetic analyses and their role in understanding the systematics and evolutionary history of understudied organismal groups.},

@article{Hykin2015,
	abstract = {For 150 years or more, specimens were routinely collected and deposited in natural history collections without preserving fresh tissue samples for genetic analysis. In the case of most herpetological specimens (i.e. amphibians and reptiles), attempts to extract and sequence DNA from formalin-fixed, ethanol-preserved specimens---particularly for use in phylogenetic analyses---has been laborious and largely ineffective due to the highly fragmented nature of the DNA. As a result, tens of thousands of specimens in herpetological collections have not been available for sequence-based phylogenetic studies. Massively parallel High-Throughput Sequencing methods and the associated bioinformatics, however, are particularly suited to recovering meaningful genetic markers from severely degraded/fragmented DNA sequences such as DNA damaged by formalin-fixation. In this study, we compared previously published DNA extraction methods on three tissue types subsampled from formalin-fixed specimens of Anolis carolinensis, followed by sequencing. Sufficient quality DNA was recovered from liver tissue, making this technique minimally destructive to museum specimens. Sequencing was only successful for the more recently collected specimen (collected ~30 ybp). We suspect this could be due either to the conditions of preservation and/or the amount of tissue used for extraction purposes. For the successfully sequenced sample, we found a high rate of base misincorporation. After rigorous trimming, we successfully mapped 27.93% of the cleaned reads to the reference genome, were able to reconstruct the complete mitochondrial genome, and recovered an accurate phylogenetic placement for our specimen. We conclude that the amount of DNA available, which can vary depending on specimen age and preservation conditions, will determine if sequencing will be successful. The technique described here will greatly improve the value of museum collections by making many formalin-fixed specimens available for genetic analysis.},

	abstract = {Natural history collections provide an immense record of biodiversity on Earth. These repositories have traditionally been used to address fundamental questions in biogeography, systematics and conservation. However, they also hold the potential for studying evolution directly. While some of the best direct observations of evolution have come from long-term field studies or from experimental studies in the laboratory, natural history collections are providing new insights into evolutionary change in natural populations. By comparing phenotypic and genotypic changes in populations through time, natural history collections provide a window into evolutionary processes. Recent studies utilizing this approach have revealed some dramatic instances of phenotypic change over short timescales in response to presumably strong selective pressures. In some instances, evolutionary change can be paired with environmental change, providing a context for potential selective forces. Moreover, in a few cases, the genetic basis of phenotypic change is well understood, allowing for insight into adaptive change at multiple levels. These kinds of studies open the door to a wide range of previously intractable questions by enabling the study of evolution through time, analogous to experimental studies in the laboratory, but amenable to a diversity of species over longer timescales in natural populations.},

	abstract = {<p>Antarctic specimens collected during various research expeditions are preserved in natural history collections around the world potentially offering a cornucopia of morphological and molecular data. Historical samples of marine species are, however, often preserved in formaldehyde which may render them useless for genetic analysis. We sampled stomachs and hindguts from 225 <italic>Trematomus</italic> specimens from the Natural History Museum London. These samples were initially collected between 20 and 100 years ago and fixed in either formaldehyde or ethanol. A 313 bp fragment of the cytochrome c oxidase subunit I (COI) was amplified and sequenced for prey item identification in the stomach and a 450 bp region of the 16S rRNA gene to investigate microbiome composition in the gut system. Both data sets were characterized by large dropout rates during extensive quality controls. Eventually, no unambiguous results regarding stomach content (COI) were retained, possibly due to degraded DNA, inefficient primers and contamination. In contrast, reliable microbiome composition data (16S rRNA) was obtained from 26 samples. These data showed a correlation in change of microbiome composition with fish size as well as year of the catch, indicating a microbiome shift throughout ontogeny and between samples from different decades. A comparison with contemporary samples indicated that the intestinal microbiome of <italic>Trematomus</italic> may have drastically changed within the last century. Further extensive studies are needed to confirm these patterns with higher sample numbers. Molecular analyses of museum stored fish can provide novel micro evolutionary insights that may benefit current efforts to prioritize conservation units in the Southern Ocean.</p>},

@article{Chalifour2022,
	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Museum biological specimens provide a unique means of gathering ecological information that spans wide temporal ranges. Museum specimens can also provide information on the microbial communities that persist within the host specimen. Together, these provide researchers valuable opportunities to study long-term trends and mechanisms of microbial community change. The effects of decades-long museum preservation on host-microbial communities have not been systematically assessed. The University of Colorado's Museum of Natural History has densely sampled Oreohelix strigosa (Rocky Mountainsnail) for the past century; many are preserved in ethanol, which provides an excellent opportunity to explore how the microbiome changes across time in preservation. RESULTS: We used 16S rRNA (ribosomal ribonucleic acid) gene amplicon sequencing to examine Oreohelix strigosa gut microbiomes from museum specimens across a 98-year range, as well as within short-term preservation treatments collected in 2018. Treatment groups included samples extracted fresh, without preservation; samples starved prior to extraction; and samples preserved for 1 month, 6 months, and 9 months. General microbiome composition was similar across all years. Sample groups belonging to specific years, or specific short-term treatments, showed unique associations with select bacterial taxa. Collection year was not a significant predictor of microbial richness, though unpreserved short-term treatments showed significantly higher richness than preserved treatments. While the year was a significant factor in microbiome composition, it did not explain much of the variation across samples. The location was a significant driver of community composition and explained more of the variability. CONCLUSIONS: This study is the first to examine animal host-associated microbiome change across a period of nearly one century. Generally, geographic location was a greater factor in shaping gut microbiome composition, rather than a year collected. Consistent patterns across this temporal range indicate that historic specimens can answer many ecological questions surrounding the host-associated microbiome. Video Abstract.},

	abstract = {Scientists have been studying ancient DNA for three decades, but next-generation sequencing (NGS) has made the process of sequencing ancient DNA much easier. This technological leap has huge potential for genomic analysis of the very museum specimens that already form the foundation of prior knowledge about biodiversity. We are still determining which methods of preparing ancient DNA for NGS work best for various questions, especially with regard to whether whole genomes need to be sequenced or whether a subset of the genome is more desirable and computationally tractable. In this chapter, we discuss different methods for preparing ancient DNA for NGS, and various analytical issues specific to NGS data output from ancient DNA sources. We focus mainly on birds and discuss several case studies where NGS has been applied to very old museum specimens, like subfossils, as well as younger specimens, like those from museum study skins collected in the last century. Although few recently published studies using NGS are about ancient DNA from bird museum specimens, the number is expected to grow rapidly. The case studies demonstrate that systematics and taxonomy are important applications of NGS to museum specimens, and that plenty remains to be learned from specimens about population-level processes such as the genetics of changes in population size, some of which have led to extinction. Better methods of extracting ancient DNA from museum specimens are badly needed, as well as careful consideration of how the research community archives DNA extractions and the billions of DNA sequencing reads now being produced from museum specimens on NGS platforms. Methods for correcting errors that occur during NGS, as well as those introduced during the process of DNA degradation in the specimen itself (e.g., deamination), are in development, but easy-to-use pipelines are still lacking. In sum, although methods are still in development, the field of next-generation museum genomics is burgeoning, with high potential to extend the utility of museum specimens in bird systematics, historical demography, and conservation.},

@article{Callewaert2020,
	abstract = {Advances in sequencing, bioinformatics and analytics now allow the structure, function and interrelations of whole microbial communities to be studied in greater detail. Collaborative efforts and multidisciplinary studies, crossing the boundary between environmental and medical microbiology, have allowed specific environmental, animal and human microbiomes to be characterized. One of the main challenges for microbial ecology is to link the phylogenetic diversity of host-associated microbes to their functional roles within the community. Much remains to be learned on the way microbes colonize the skin of different living organisms and the way the skin microbiome reacts to the surrounding environment (air, water, etc.). In this review, we discuss examples of recent studies that have used modern technology to provide insights into microbial communities in water and on skin, such as those in natural resources (thermal spring water), large mammals (humpback whales) and humans (the skin microbiome). The results of these studies demonstrate how a greater understanding of the structure and functioning of microbiota, together with their interactions with the environment, may facilitate the discovery of new probiotics or postbiotics, provide indicators for the quality of the environment, and show how changes in lifestyle and living environment, such as urbanization, can impact on the skin microbiome and skin health and disease in humans.},

@article{Rosenberg2011,
	abstract = {All animals and plants establish symbiotic relationships with microorganisms; often the combined genetic information of the diverse microbiota exceeds that of the host. How the genetic wealth of the microbiota affects all aspects of the holobiont's (host plus all of its associated microorganisms) fitness (adaptation, survival, development, growth and reproduction) and evolution is reviewed, using selected coral, insect, squid, plant, and human/mouse published experimental results. The data are discussed within the framework of the hologenome theory of evolution, which demonstrates that changes in environmental parameters, for example, diet, can cause rapid changes in the diverse microbiota, which not only can benefit the holobiont in the short term but also can be transmitted to offspring and lead to long lasting cooperations. As acquired characteristics (microbes) are heritable, consideration of the holobiont as a unit of selection in evolution leads to neo-Lamarckian principles within a Darwinian framework. The potential application of these principles can be seen in the growing fields of prebiotics and probiotics.},

	abstract = {Asterophryinae is a large monophyletic subfamily of Anurans containing over 300 species distributed across one of the world's most geologically active areas -- New Guinea and its satellite islands, Australia and the Philippines. The tremendous ecological and morphological diversity of this clade, with apparent specializations for burrowing, terrestrial, semi-aquatic, and arboreal lifestyle, suggests an evolutionary process of adaptive radiation. Despite this spectacular diversity, this and many other questions of evolutionary processes have received little formal study because until now the phylogeny of this spececies-rich clade has remained uncertain. Here we reconstruct a phylogeny for Asterophryinae with greatly increased taxon and genetic sampling relative to prior studies. We use Maximum Likelihood and Bayesian Inference methods to produce the most robust and comprehensive phylogeny to date containing 155 species using 3 nuclear and 2 mitochondrial loci. We also perform a time calibration analysis to estimate the age of the clade. We find support for the monophyly of Asterophryinae as well as need for taxonomic reclassification of several genera. Furthermore, we find increased rates of speciation across the clade supporting the hypothesis of rapid radiation. Lastly, we found that adding taxa to the analysis produced more robust phylogenetic results over adding loci.},

	abstract = {Skin barrier structure and function is essential to human health. Hitherto unrecognized functions of epidermal keratinocytes show that the skin plays an important role in adapting whole-body physiology to changing environments, including the capacity to produce a wide variety of hormones, neurotransmitters and cytokine that can potentially influence whole-body states, and quite possibly, even emotions. Skin microbiota play an integral role in the maturation and homeostatic regulation of keratinocytes and host immune networks with systemic implications. As our primary interface with the external environment, the biodiversity of skin habitats is heavily influenced by the biodiversity of the ecosystems in which we reside. Thus, factors which alter the establishment and health of the skin microbiome have the potential to predispose to not only cutaneous disease, but also other inflammatory non-communicable diseases (NCDs). Indeed, disturbances of the stratum corneum have been noted in allergic diseases (eczema and food allergy), psoriasis, rosacea, acne vulgaris and with the skin aging process. The built environment, global biodiversity losses and declining nature relatedness are contributing to erosion of diversity at a micro-ecological level, including our own microbial habitats. This emphasises the importance of ecological perspectives in overcoming the factors that drive dysbiosis and the risk of inflammatory diseases across the life course.},

	abstract = {<p>In response to the current worldwide amphibian extinction crisis, conservation instances have encouraged the establishment of <italic>ex-situ</italic> collections for endangered species. The resulting assurance populations are managed under strict biosecure protocols, often involving artificial cycles of temperature and humidity to induce active and overwintering phases, which likely affect the bacterial symbionts living on the amphibian skin. However, the skin microbiota is an important first line of defense against pathogens that can cause amphibian declines, such as the chytrid <italic>Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis (Bd)</italic>. Determining whether current husbandry practices for assurance populations might deplete amphibians from their symbionts is therefore essential to conservation success. Here, we characterize the effect of the transitions from the wild to captivity, and between aquatic and overwintering phases, on the skin microbiota of two newt species. While our results confirm differential selectivity of skin microbiota between species, they underscore that captivity and phase-shifts similarly affect their community structure. More specifically, the translocation <italic>ex-situ</italic> is associated with rapid impoverishment, decrease in alpha diversity and strong species turnover of bacterial communities. Shifts between active and overwintering phases also cause changes in the diversity and composition of the microbiota, and on the prevalence of <italic>Bd</italic>-inhibitory phylotypes. Altogether, our results suggest that current husbandry practices strongly restructure the amphibian skin microbiota. Although it remains to be determined whether these changes are reversible or have deleterious effects on their hosts, we discuss methods to limit microbial diversity loss <italic>ex-situ</italic> and emphasize the importance of integrating bacterial communities to applied amphibian conservation.</p>},
