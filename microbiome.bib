	abstract = {Uropeltidae is a clade of small fossorial snakes (ca. 64 extant species) endemic to peninsular India and Sri Lanka. Uropeltid taxonomy has been confusing, and the status of some species has not been revised for over a century. Attempts to revise uropeltid systematics and undertake evolutionary studies have been hampered by incompletely sampled and incompletely resolved phylogenies. To address this issue, we take advantage of historical museum collections, including type specimens, and apply genome-wide shotgun (GWS) sequencing, along with recent field sampling (using Sanger sequencing) to establish a near-complete multilocus species-level phylogeny (ca. 87% complete at species level). This results in a phylogeny that supports the monophyly of all genera (if Brachyophidium is considered a junior synonym of Teretrurus), and provides a firm platform for future taxonomic revision. Sri Lankan uropeltids are probably monophyletic, indicating a single colonisation event of this island from Indian ancestors. However, the position of Rhinophis goweri (endemic to Eastern Ghats, southern India) is unclear and warrants further investigation, and evidence that it may nest within the Sri Lankan radiation indicates a possible recolonisation event. DNA sequence data and morphology suggest that currently recognised uropeltid species diversity is substantially underestimated. Our study highlights the benefits of integrating museum collections in molecular genetic analyses and their role in understanding the systematics and evolutionary history of understudied organismal groups.},

@article{Chalifour:2022,
	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Museum biological specimens provide a unique means of gathering ecological information that spans wide temporal ranges. Museum specimens can also provide information on the microbial communities that persist within the host specimen. Together, these provide researchers valuable opportunities to study long-term trends and mechanisms of microbial community change. The effects of decades-long museum preservation on host-microbial communities have not been systematically assessed. The University of Colorado's Museum of Natural History has densely sampled Oreohelix strigosa (Rocky Mountainsnail) for the past century; many are preserved in ethanol, which provides an excellent opportunity to explore how the microbiome changes across time in preservation. RESULTS: We used 16S rRNA (ribosomal ribonucleic acid) gene amplicon sequencing to examine Oreohelix strigosa gut microbiomes from museum specimens across a 98-year range, as well as within short-term preservation treatments collected in 2018. Treatment groups included samples extracted fresh, without preservation; samples starved prior to extraction; and samples preserved for 1 month, 6 months, and 9 months. General microbiome composition was similar across all years. Sample groups belonging to specific years, or specific short-term treatments, showed unique associations with select bacterial taxa. Collection year was not a significant predictor of microbial richness, though unpreserved short-term treatments showed significantly higher richness than preserved treatments. While the year was a significant factor in microbiome composition, it did not explain much of the variation across samples. The location was a significant driver of community composition and explained more of the variability. CONCLUSIONS: This study is the first to examine animal host-associated microbiome change across a period of nearly one century. Generally, geographic location was a greater factor in shaping gut microbiome composition, rather than a year collected. Consistent patterns across this temporal range indicate that historic specimens can answer many ecological questions surrounding the host-associated microbiome. Video Abstract.},

@article{Madison:2023,
	abstract = {The use of museum specimens for research in microbial evolutionary ecology remains an under-utilized investigative dimension with important potential. Despite this potential, there remain barriers in methodology and analysis to the wide-spread adoption of museum specimens for such studies. Here, we hypothesized that there would be significant differences in taxonomic prediction and related diversity among sample type (museum or fresh) and sequencing strategy (medium-depth shotgun metagenomic or 16S rRNA gene). We found dramatically higher predicted diversity from shotgun metagenomics when compared to 16S rRNA gene sequencing in museum and fresh samples, with this differential being larger in museum specimens. Broadly confirming these hypotheses, the highest diversity found in fresh samples was with shotgun sequencing using the Rep200 reference inclusive of viruses and microeukaryotes, followed by the WoL reference database. In museum-specimens, community diversity metrics also differed significantly between sequencing strategies, with the alpha-diversity ACE differential being significantly greater than the same comparisons made for fresh specimens. Beta diversity results were more variable, with significance dependent on reference databases used. Taken together, these findings demonstrate important differences in diversity results and prompt important considerations for future experiments and downstream analyses aiming to incorporate microbiome datasets from museum specimens.},

@article{Heindler:2018,
	abstract = {<p>Antarctic specimens collected during various research expeditions are preserved in natural history collections around the world potentially offering a cornucopia of morphological and molecular data. Historical samples of marine species are, however, often preserved in formaldehyde which may render them useless for genetic analysis. We sampled stomachs and hindguts from 225 <italic>Trematomus</italic> specimens from the Natural History Museum London. These samples were initially collected between 20 and 100 years ago and fixed in either formaldehyde or ethanol. A 313 bp fragment of the cytochrome c oxidase subunit I (COI) was amplified and sequenced for prey item identification in the stomach and a 450 bp region of the 16S rRNA gene to investigate microbiome composition in the gut system. Both data sets were characterized by large dropout rates during extensive quality controls. Eventually, no unambiguous results regarding stomach content (COI) were retained, possibly due to degraded DNA, inefficient primers and contamination. In contrast, reliable microbiome composition data (16S rRNA) was obtained from 26 samples. These data showed a correlation in change of microbiome composition with fish size as well as year of the catch, indicating a microbiome shift throughout ontogeny and between samples from different decades. A comparison with contemporary samples indicated that the intestinal microbiome of <italic>Trematomus</italic> may have drastically changed within the last century. Further extensive studies are needed to confirm these patterns with higher sample numbers. Molecular analyses of museum stored fish can provide novel micro evolutionary insights that may benefit current efforts to prioritize conservation units in the Southern Ocean.</p>},

@article{Hykin:2015,
	abstract = {For 150 years or more, specimens were routinely collected and deposited in natural history collections without preserving fresh tissue samples for genetic analysis. In the case of most herpetological specimens (i.e. amphibians and reptiles), attempts to extract and sequence DNA from formalin-fixed, ethanol-preserved specimens---particularly for use in phylogenetic analyses---has been laborious and largely ineffective due to the highly fragmented nature of the DNA. As a result, tens of thousands of specimens in herpetological collections have not been available for sequence-based phylogenetic studies. Massively parallel High-Throughput Sequencing methods and the associated bioinformatics, however, are particularly suited to recovering meaningful genetic markers from severely degraded/fragmented DNA sequences such as DNA damaged by formalin-fixation. In this study, we compared previously published DNA extraction methods on three tissue types subsampled from formalin-fixed specimens of Anolis carolinensis, followed by sequencing. Sufficient quality DNA was recovered from liver tissue, making this technique minimally destructive to museum specimens. Sequencing was only successful for the more recently collected specimen (collected ~30 ybp). We suspect this could be due either to the conditions of preservation and/or the amount of tissue used for extraction purposes. For the successfully sequenced sample, we found a high rate of base misincorporation. After rigorous trimming, we successfully mapped 27.93% of the cleaned reads to the reference genome, were able to reconstruct the complete mitochondrial genome, and recovered an accurate phylogenetic placement for our specimen. We conclude that the amount of DNA available, which can vary depending on specimen age and preservation conditions, will determine if sequencing will be successful. The technique described here will greatly improve the value of museum collections by making many formalin-fixed specimens available for genetic analysis.},
