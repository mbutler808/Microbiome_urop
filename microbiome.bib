@article{Srivathsan:2021,
	abstract = {Background DNA barcodes are a useful tool for discovering,
   understanding, and monitoring biodiversity which are critical tasks at a
   time of rapid biodiversity loss. However, widespread adoption of
   barcodes requires cost-effective and simple barcoding methods. We here
   present a workflow that satisfies these conditions. It was developed via
   ``innovation through subtraction{''} and thus requires minimal lab
   equipment, can be learned within days, reduces the barcode sequencing
   cost to < 10 cents, and allows fast turnaround from specimen to sequence
   by using the portable MinION sequencer. Results We describe how tagged
   amplicons can be obtained and sequenced with the real-time MinION
   sequencer in many settings (field stations, biodiversity labs, citizen
   science labs, schools). We also provide amplicon coverage
   recommendations that are based on several runs of the latest generation
   of MinION flow cells ({''}R10.3{''}) which suggest that each run can
   generate barcodes for > 10,000 specimens. Next, we present a novel
   software, ONTbarcoder, which overcomes the bioinformatics challenges
   posed by MinION reads. The software is compatible with Windows 10,
   Macintosh, and Linux, has a graphical user interface (GUI), and can
   generate thousands of barcodes on a standard laptop within hours based
   on only two input files (FASTQ, demultiplexing file). We document that
   MinION barcodes are virtually identical to Sanger and Illumina barcodes
   for the same specimens (> 99.99\%) and provide evidence that MinION flow
   cells and reads have improved rapidly since 2018. Conclusions We propose
   that barcoding with MinION is the way forward for government agencies,
   universities, museums, and schools because it combines low consumable
   and capital cost with scalability. Small projects can use the flow cell
   dongle ({''}Flongle{''}) while large projects can rely on MinION flow
   cells that can be stopped and re-used after collecting sufficient data
   for a given project.},

@article{Vasilita:2024,
	abstract = {The use of DNA barcoding is well established for specimen identification
   and large-scale biodiversity discovery, but remains underutilized for
   time-sensitive applications such as rapid species discovery in field
   stations, identifying pests, citizen science projects, and
   authenticating food. The main reason is that existing express barcoding
   workflows are either too expensive or can only be used in very
   well-equipped laboratories by highly-trained staff. We here show an
   alternative workflow combining rapid DNA extraction with HotSHOT,
   amplicon production with NextGenPCR thermocyclers, and sequencing with
   low-cost MinION sequencers. We demonstrate the power of the approach by
   generating 250 barcodes for 285 specimens within 6 h including specimen
   identification through BLAST. The workflow required only the following
   major equipment that easily fits onto a lab bench: Thermocycler,
   NextGenPCR, microplate sealer, Qubit, and MinION. Based on our results,
   we argue that simplified barcoding workflows for species-level sorting
   are now faster, more accurate, and sufficiently cost-effective to
   replace traditional morpho-species sorting in many projects.},

@article{Albecker:2019,
	abstract = {Amphibians host a community of microbes on their skin that helps resist
   infectious disease via the dual influence of anti-pathogenic microbial
   species and emergent community dynamics. Many frogs rely on freshwater
   habitats, but salinization is rapidly increasing saltwater
   concentrations in wetlands around the globe, increasing the likelihood
   that frogs will come into contact with salt-contaminated habitats.
   Currently, we know little about how increased salt exposure will affect
   the symbiotic relationship between the skin microbes and frog hosts. To
   better understand how salt exposure in a natural context affects the
   frog skin microbiome, we use Hyla cinerea, a North American treefrog
   species that can inhabit brackish wetlands, to explore three questions.
   First, we determine the extent that microbial communities in the
   environment and on frog skin are similar across populations. Second, we
   assess the microbial species richness and relative abundance on frogs
   from habitats with different salinity levels to determine how salinity
   affects the microbiome. Third, we test whether the relative abundances
   of putatively pathogen-resistant bacterial species differ between frogs
   from inland and coastal environments. We found that the frog microbiome
   is more similar among frogs than to the microbial communities found in
   surface water and soil, but there is overlap between frog skin and the
   environmental samples. Skin microbial community richness did not differ
   among populations, but the relative abundances of microbes were
   different across populations and salinities. We found no differences in
   the relative abundances of the anti-fungal bacteria Janthinobacterium
   lividum, the genus Pseudomonas, and Serratia marcescens, suggesting that
   environmental exposure to saltwater has a limited influence on these
   putatively beneficial bacterial taxa.},

@article{Belasen:2021,
	abstract = {The host-associated microbiome plays a significant role in health.
   However, the roles of factors such as host genetics and microbial
   interactions in determining microbiome diversity remain unclear. We
   examined these factors using amplicon-based sequencing of 175 Thoropa
   taophora frog skin swabs collected from a naturally fragmented landscape
   in southeastern Brazil. Specifically, we examined (1) the effects of
   geography and host genetics on microbiome diversity and structure; (2)
   the structure of microbial eukaryotic and bacterial co-occurrence
   networks; and (3) co-occurrence between microeukaryotes with bacterial
   OTUs known to affect growth of the fungal pathogen Batrachochytrium
   dendrobatidis (Bd). While bacterial alpha diversity varied by both site
   type and host MHC IIB genotype, microeukaryotic alpha diversity varied
   only by site type. However, bacteria and microeukaryote composition
   showed variation according to both site type and host MHC IIB genotype.
   Our network analysis showed the highest connectivity when both
   eukaryotes and bacteria were included, implying that ecological
   interactions may occur among domains. Lastly, anti-Bd bacteria were not
   broadly negatively co-associated with the fungal microbiome and were
   positively associated with potential amphibian parasites. Our findings
   emphasize the importance of considering both domains in microbiome
   research and suggest that for effective probiotic strategies for
   amphibian disease management, considering potential interactions among
   all members of the microbiome is crucial.},

@article{Belden:2015,
	abstract = {Vertebrates, including amphibians, host diverse symbiotic microbes that
   contribute to host disease resistance. Globally, and especially in
   montane tropical systems, many amphibian species are threatened by a
   chytrid fungus, Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis (Bd), that causes a
   lethal skin disease. Bd therefore may be a strong selective agent on the
   diversity and function of the microbial communities inhabiting amphibian
   skin. In Panama, amphibian population declines and the spread of Bd have
   been tracked. In 2012, we completed a field survey in Panama to examine
   frog skin microbiota in the context of Bd infection. We focused on three
   frog species and collected two skin swabs per frog from a total of 136
   frogs across four sites that varied from west to east in the time since
   Bd arrival. One swab was used to assess bacterial community structure
   using 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing and to determine Bd infection status,
   and one was used to assess metabolite diversity, as the bacterial
   production of anti fungal metabolites is an important disease resistance
   function. The skin microbiota of the three Panamanian frog species
   differed in OTU (operational taxonomic unit, bacterial species)
   community composition and metabolite profiles, although the pattern was
   less strong for the metabolites. Comparisons between frog skin bacterial
   communities from Panama and the US suggest broad similarities at the
   phylum level, but key differences at lower taxonomic levels. In our
   field survey in Panama, across all four sites, only 35 individuals
   (similar to 26\%) were Bd infected. There was no clustering of OTUs or
   metabolite profiles based on Bd infection status and no clear pattern of
   west east changes in OTUs or metabolite profiles across the four sites.
   Overall, our field survey data suggest that different bacterial
   communities might be producing broadly similar sets of metabolites
   across frog hosts and sites. Community structure and function may not be
   as tightly coupled in these skin symbiont microbial systems as it is in
   many macro systems.},

	abstract = {Microbiomes play an important role in determining the ecology and
   behaviour of their hosts. However, questions remain pertaining to how
   host genetics shape microbiomes, and how microbiome composition
   influences host fitness. We explored the effects of geography,
   evolutionary history and host genetics on the skin microbiome diversity
   and structure in a widespread amphibian. More specifically, we examined
   the association between bacterial diversity and composition and the
   major histocompatibility complex class II exon 2 diversity in 12 moor
   frog (Rana arvalis) populations belonging to two geographical clusters
   that show signatures of past and ongoing differential selection. We
   found that while bacterial alpha diversity did not differ between the
   two clusters, MHC alleles/supertypes and genetic diversity varied
   considerably depending on geography and evolutionary history. Bacterial
   alpha diversity was positively correlated with expected MHC
   heterozygosity and negatively with MHC nucleotide diversity.
   Furthermore, bacterial community composition showed significant
   variation between the two geographical clusters and between specific MHC
   alleles/supertypes. Our findings emphasize the importance of historical
   demographic events on hologenomic variation and provide new insights
   into how immunogenetic host variability and microbial diversity may

	abstract = {Potential synergetic interaction between chemicals, climate change and
   the emergence of opportunistic diseases is of utmost concern within the
   amphibian decline scenario. Understand the structure and dynamic of this
   microbiome and how environmental stressors act on this community is a
   priority. The present study aimed to: i) characterize the skin
   microbiome of Pelophylax perezi frog by looking for variations between
   populations in reference and under stress conditions (one metal
   contaminated and another with salinity fluctuations) and ii) evaluate
   the tolerance of skin-isolated bacteria to chemical contamination. Skin
   swabs were collected from frog populations inhabiting three reference
   sites (LB, VA and AM), one metal-rich contaminated (TP) and one brackish
   lentic aquatic system (SL). The frogs' skin microbiome was characterized
   by culture independent method (DGGE) and by cultivation methods. DGGE
   showed a characteristic profile in frogs from TP population. Results of
   recovered communities revealed low morphotype diversity and density
   (Colony Forming Units per frog) on individuals from TP population,
   comparatively to the other sampled populations. Isolated bacteria
   identified based on 16S rRNA gene sequence belong mainly to the classes
   Actinobacteria and Alphaproteobacteria. Ecotoxicological assays with
   acid-metal contaminated effluent (ETP) showed that the percentage of
   tolerant strains was higher in frogs from TP population than in SL and
   LB populations. In conclusion, results suggest that: a) environmental
   specific characteristics, as the presence of chemical contaminants,
   influence the composition of amphibian microbiome, comparing with sites
   without such contaminants; b) there are differences in microbiome
   composition between populations; and c) bacteria historically exposed to
   effluent may evolve tolerance to this kind of contamination. (C) 2016

@article{Douglas:2021,
	abstract = {While a number of amphibian skin microbiomes have been characterized, it
   is unclear how these communities might vary in response to seasonal
   changes in the environment and the corresponding behaviors that many
   amphibians exhibit. Given recent studies demonstrating the importance of
   the skin microbiome in frog innate immune defense against pathogens,
   investigating how changes in the environment impact the microbial
   species present will provide a better understanding of conditions that
   may alter host susceptibility to pathogens in their environment. We
   sampled the bacterial skin microbiome of North American wood frogs (Rana
   sylvatica) from two breeding ponds in the spring, along with the
   bacterial community present in their vernal breeding pools, and frogs
   from the nearby forest floor in the summer and fall to determine whether
   community composition differs by sex, vernal pond site, or temporally
   across season (spring, summer, fall). Taxon relative abundance data
   reveals a profile of bacterial phyla similar to those previously
   described on anuran skin, with Proteobacteria, Bacteroidetes, and
   Actinobacteria dominating the wood frog skin microbiome. Our results
   indicate that sex had no significant effect on skin microbiota
   diversity; however, this may be due to our limited female frog sample
   size. Vernal pool site had a small but significant effect on skin
   microbiota, but skin-associated communities were more similar to each
   other than to the communities observed in the frogs' respective pond
   water. Across seasons, diversity analyses suggest that there are
   significant differences between the bacterial skin microbiome of frogs
   from spring and summer/fall groups while the average alpha-diversity per
   frog remained consistent. These results illustrate seasonal variation in

	abstract = {Microbial symbionts are increasingly recognized as playing a critical
   role in organismal health across a wide range of hosts. Amphibians are
   unique hosts in that their skin helps to regulate the exchange of water,
   ions, and gases, and it plays an active role in defense against
   pathogens through the synthesis of anti-microbial peptides. The
   microbiome of amphibian skin includes a diverse community of bacteria
   known to defend against pathogens, including the global pandemic lineage
   of Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis associated with mass amphibian
   die-offs. The relative influence of host phylogeny and environment in
   determining the composition of the amphibian skin microbiome remains
   poorly understood. We collected skin swabs from montane amphibians in
   Mexico and Guatemala, focusing on two genera of plethodontid salamanders
   and one genus of frogs. We used high throughput sequencing to
   characterize the skin bacterial microbiome and tested the impact of
   phylogeny and habitat on bacterial diversity. Our results show that
   phylogenetic history strongly influences the diversity and community
   structure of the total bacterial microbiome at higher taxonomic levels
   (between orders), but on lower scales (within genera and species), the
   effect of habitat predominates. These results add to a growing consensus
   that habitat exerts a strong effect on microbiome structure and

   Our analysis suggests amphibian skin bacterial communities change across

   Additionally, we found that skin bacterial communities differed among
   Ranid species, with skin communities on the host species captured in

   diseases. However, the effects of environmental and host factors on
   symbiotic bacterial communities are not well understood. Caribbean frogs
   in the genus Eleutherodactylus represent a case of congeneric species
   that differ in ecological specialization by the process of adaptive
   radiation. For a small clade of Eleutherodactylus from Puerto Rico, we
   investigated the role of local environments, host species, and
   microhabitat in the composition of their skin microbiome. The potential
   congruence between microbial communities in hosts that are most closely
   related phylogenetically was also addressed. We hypothesized that the
   skin microbiota of Eleutherodactylus frogs would be mostly associated to
   microhabitat use, but also differ according to locality, and to a lesser
   extent to host species. To test this hypothesis, we swabbed the skin of
   a total of 98 adult individuals of seven Eleutherodactylus species
   distributed in two nearby localities in Puerto Rico, and sequenced the
   V4 region of the 16S rRNA gene. Results showed that locality had the
   greatest effect on determining skin bacterial communities of amphibian
   hosts, but this effect was stronger on the composition (based on
   presence/absence) than on its structure (based on sequence abundance).
   The most ecologically distinct host, E. cooki, and the generalist E.
   coqui presented, respectively, the most dissimilar and similar
   microbiota compared to other hosts. Host phylogeny showed a weak
   influence on skin microbiota. Results suggest that both local

	abstract = {Host-associated microbial communities are ubiquitous among animals, and
   serve important functions. For example, the bacterial skin microbiome of
   amphibians can play a role in preventing or reducing infection by the
   amphibian chytrid fungus, Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis. Evidence
   suggests that environmental bacteria likely serve as a source pool for
   at least some of the members of the amphibian skin bacterial community,
   underscoring the potential for local environmental changes to disrupt
   microbial community source pools that could be critical to the health of
   host organisms. However, few studies have assessed variation in the
   amphibian skin microbiome along clear environmental gradients, and so we
   know relatively little about how local environmental conditions
   influence microbiome diversity. We sampled the skin bacterial
   communities of Coqui frogs, Eleutherodactylus coqui (N = 77), along an
   elevational gradient in eastern Puerto Rico (0 -875 m), with transects
   in two land use types: intact forest (N = 4 sites) and disturbed (N = 3
   sites) forest. We found that alpha diversity (as assessed by Shannon,
   Simpson, and Phylogenetic Diversity indices) varied across sites, but
   this variation was not correlated with elevation or land use. Beta
   diversity (community structure), on the other hand, varied with site,
   elevation and land use, primarily due to changes in the relative
   abundance of certain bacterial OTUs (similar to species) within these
   communities. Importantly, although microbiome diversity varied, E. coqui
   maintained a common core microbiota across all sites. Thus, our findings
   suggest that environmental conditions can influence the composition of
   the skin microbiome of terrestrial amphibians, but that some aspects of
   the microbiome remain consistent despite environmental variation.},

   opportunities to evaluate the contribution of large-scale factors to

   assess variation in the bacterial symbiont communities on adult frog
   skin (Pseudacris crucifer), characterized using 16S rRNA gene amplicon

   diverse than, and structurally distinct from, the surrounding habitat.
   Frog skin was typically dominated by one of two bacterial OTUs: at
   western sites, a Proteobacteria dominated the community, whereas eastern
   sites were dominated by an Actinobacteria. Using a metacommunity
   framework, we then sought to identify factors explaining small- and
   large-scale variation in community structure-that is, among hosts within
   a pond, and among ponds spanning the study transect. We focused on the
   presence of a fungal skin pathogen, Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis (Bd)
   as one potential driver of variation. We found no direct link between

@article{Jani:2018,
	abstract = {Symbiotic microbial communities play key roles in the health and
   development of their multicellular hosts. Understanding why microbial
   communities vary among different host species or individuals is an
   important step toward understanding the diversity and function of the
   microbiome. The amphibian skin microbiome may affect resistance to the
   fungal pathogen Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis (Bd). Still, the factors
   that determine the diversity and composition of the amphibian skin
   microbiome, and therefore may ultimately contribute to disease
   resistance, are not well understood. We conducted a two-phase experiment
   to first test how host and environment shape the amphibian skin
   microbiome, and then test if the microbiome affects or is affected by Bd
   infection. Most lab experiments testing assembly of the amphibian skin
   microbiome so far have compared sterile to non-sterile environments or
   heavily augmented to non-augmented frogs. A goal of this study was to
   evaluate, in an experimental setting, realistic potential drivers of
   microbiome assembly that would be relevant to patterns observed in
   nature. We tested effects of frog genetic background (2 source
   populations) and 6 natural lake water sources in shaping the microbiome
   of the frog Rana sierrae. Water in which frogs were housed affected the
   microbiome in a manner that partially mimicked patterns observed in
   natural populations. In particular, frogs housed in water from
   disease-resistant populations had greater bacterial richness than frogs
   housed in water from populations that died out due to Bd. However, in
   the experiment this difference in microbiomes did not lead to
   differences in host mortality or rates of pathogen load increase. Frog
   source population also affected the microbiome and, although none of the
   frogs in this study showed true resistance to infection, host source
   population had a small effect on the rate of pathogen load increase.
   This difference in infection trajectories could be due to the observed
   differences in the microbiome, but could also be due to other traits
   that differ between frogs from the two populations. In addition to
   examining effects of the microbiome on Bd, we tested the effect of Bd
   infection severity on the microbiome. Specifically, we studied a time
   series of the microbiome over the course of infection to test if the
   effects of Bd on the microbiome are dependent on Bd infection severity.
   Although limited to a small subset of frogs, time series analysis
   suggested that relative abundances of several bacterial phylotypes
   changed as Bd loads increased through time, indicating that Bd-induced
   disturbance of the R. sierrae microbiome is not a binary effect but
   instead is dependent on infection severity. We conclude that both host
   and aquatic environment help shape the R. sierrae skin microbiome, with
   links to small changes in disease resistance in some cases, but in this
   study the effect of Bd on the microbiome was greater than the effect of
   the microbiome on Bd. Assessment of the microbiome differences between
   more distantly related populations than those studied here is needed to
   fully understand the role of the microbiome in resistance to Bd.},

@article{Jimenez:2020,
	abstract = {Background The skin microbiome serves as a first line defense against
   pathogens in vertebrates. In amphibians, it has the potential to protect
   against the chytrid fungusBatrachochytrium dendrobatis(Bd), a likely
   agent of amphibian declines. Alteration of the microbiome associated
   with unfavorable environmental changes produced by anthropogenic
   activities may make the host more susceptible to pathogens. Some
   amphibian species that were thought to be ``extinct{''} have been
   rediscovered years after population declines in the late 1980s probably
   due to evolvedBd-resistance and are now threatened by anthropogenic
   land-use changes. Understanding the effects of habitat disturbance on
   the host skin microbiome is relevant for understanding the health of
   these species, along with its susceptibility to pathogens such asBd.
   Here, we investigate the influence of habitat alteration on the skin
   bacterial communities as well as specifically the putativeBd-inhibitory
   bacterial communities of the montane frogLithobates vibicarius. This
   species, after years of not being observed, was rediscovered in small
   populations inhabiting undisturbed and disturbed landscapes, and with
   continuous presence ofBd. Results We found that cutaneous bacterial
   communities of tadpoles and adults differed between undisturbed and
   disturbed habitats. The adults from disturbed habitats exhibited greater
   community dispersion than those from undisturbed habitats. We observed a
   higher richness of putativeBd-inhibitory bacterial strains in adults
   from disturbed habitats than in those from undisturbed habitats, as well
   as a greater number of these potential protective bacteria with a high
   relative abundance. Conclusions Our findings support the microbial
   ``Anna Karenina principle{''}, in which disturbance is hypothesized to
   cause greater microbial dispersion in communities, a so-called
   dysbiosis, which is a response of animal microbiomes to stress factors
   that decrease the ability of the host or its microbiome to regulate
   community composition. On the positive side, the high richness and
   relative abundance of putativeBd-inhibitory bacteria may indicate the
   development of a defense mechanism that enhancesBd-protection,
   attributed to a co-occurrence of more than 30-years of host and pathogen
   in these disturbed habitats. Our results provide important insight into
   the influence of human-modified landscapes on the skin microbiome and
   health implications ofBd-survivor species.},

	abstract = {Describing the structure and function of the amphibian cutaneous
   microbiome has gained importance with the spread ofBatrachochytrium
   dendrobatidis(Bd), the fungal pathogen that can cause the skin disease
   chytridiomycosis. Sampling amphibian skin microbiota is needed to
   characterize current infection status and to help predict future
   susceptibility to Bd based on microbial composition since some skin
   microbes have antifungal capabilities that may confer disease
   resistance. Here, I use 16S rRNA sequencing to describe the composition
   and structure of the cutaneous microbiota of six species of amphibians.
   Frog skin samples were also tested for Bd, and I found 11.8\% Bd
   prevalence among all individuals sampled (n= 76). Frog skin microbiota
   varied by host species and sampling site, but did not differ among
   Bd-positive and Bd-negative individuals. These results suggest that
   bacterial composition reflects host species and the environment, but
   does not reflect Bd infection among the species sampled here. Of the
   bacterial OTUs identified using an indicator species analysis as
   strongly associated with amphibians, significantly more indicator OTUs
   were putative anti-Bd taxa than would be expected based on the
   proportion of anti-Bd OTUs among all frog OTUs, suggesting strong
   associations between host species and anti-Bd OTUs. This relationship
   may partially explain why some of these frogs are asymptomatic carriers
   of Bd, but more work is needed to determine the other factors that
   contribute to interspecific variation in Bd susceptibility. This work
   provides important insights on inter- and intra-specific variation in
   microbial community composition, putative function, and disease dynamics
   in populations of amphibians that appear to be coexisting with Bd.},

	abstract = {Background The amphibian skin microbiome is an important mediator of
   host health and serves as a potential source of undiscovered
   scientifically significant compounds. However, the underlying modalities
   of how amphibian hosts obtain their initial skin-associated microbiome
   remains unclear. Here, we explore microbial transmission patterns in
   foam-nest breeding tree frogs from Southeast Asia (Genus: Polypedates)
   whose specialized breeding strategy allows for better delineation
   between vertically and environmentally derived microbes. To facilitate
   this, we analyzed samples associated with adult frog pairs taken after
   mating-including adults of each sex, their foam nests, environments, and
   tadpoles before and after environmental interaction-for the bacterial
   communities using DNA metabarcoding data (16S rRNA). Samples were
   collected from frogs in-situ in Brunei, Borneo, a previously unsampled
   region for amphibian-related microbial diversity. Results Adult frogs
   differed in skin bacterial communities among species, but tadpoles did
   not differ among species. Foam nests had varying bacterial community
   composition, most notably in the nests' moist interior. Nest interior
   bacterial communities were discrete for each nest and overall displayed
   a narrower diversity compared to the nest exteriors. Tadpoles sampled
   directly from the foam nest displayed a bacterial composition less like
   the nest interior and more similar to that of the adults and nest
   exterior. After one week of pond water interaction the tadpole skin
   microbiome shifted towards the tadpole skin and pond water microbial
   communities being more tightly coupled than between tadpoles and the
   internal nest environment, but not to the extent that the skin
   microbiome mirrored the pond bacterial community. Conclusions Both
   vertical influence and environmental interaction play a role in shaping
   the tadpole cutaneous microbiome. Interestingly, the interior of the
   foam nest had a distinct bacterial community from the tadpoles
   suggesting a limited environmental effect on tadpole cutaneous bacterial
   selection at initial stages of life. The shift in the tadpole microbiome
   after environmental interaction indicates an interplay between
   underlying host and ecological mechanisms that drive community
   formation. This survey serves as a baseline for further research into
   the ecology of microbial transmission in aquatic animals.},

	abstract = {Skin symbiotic bacteria on amphibians can play a role in protecting
   their host against pathogens. Chytridiomycosis, the disease caused by
   Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis, Bd, has caused dramatic population
   declines and extinctions of amphibians worldwide. Anti-Bd bacteria from
   amphibian skin have been cultured, and skin bacterial communities have
   been described through 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing. Here, we
   present a shotgun metagenomic analysis of skin bacterial communities
   from a Neotropical frog, Craugastor fitzingeri. We sequenced the
   metagenome of six frogs from two different sites in Panama: three frogs
   from Soberania (Sob), a Bd-endemic site, and three frogs from Serrania
   del Sapo (Sapo), a Bd-naive site. We described the taxonomic composition
   of skin microbiomes and found that Pseudomonas was a major component of
   these communities. We also identified that Sob communities were enriched
   in Actinobacteria while Sapo communities were enriched in
   Gammaproteobacteria. We described gene abundances within the main
   functional classes and found genes enriched either in Sapo or Sob. We
   then focused our study on five functional classes of genes: biosynthesis
   of secondary metabolites, metabolism of terpenoids and polyketides,
   membrane transport, cellular communication and antimicrobial drug
   resistance. These gene classes are potentially involved in bacterial
   communication, bacterial-host and bacterial-pathogen interactions among
   other functions. We found that C. fitzingeri metagenomes have a wide
   array of genes that code for secondary metabolites, including
   antibiotics and bacterial toxins, which may be involved in bacterial
   communication, but could also have a defensive role against pathogens.
   Several genes involved in bacterial communication and bacterial-host
   interactions, such as biofilm formation and bacterial secretion systems
   were found. We identified specific genes and pathways enriched at the
   different sites and determined that gene co-occurrence networks differed
   between sites. Our results suggest that skin microbiomes are composed of
   distinct bacterial taxa with a wide range of metabolic capabilities
   involved in bacterial defense and communication. Differences in
   taxonomic composition and pathway enrichments suggest that skin
   microbiomes from different sites have unique functional properties. This
   study strongly supports the need for shotgun metagenomic analyses to
   describe the functional capacities of skin microbiomes and to tease
   apart their role in host defense against pathogens.},

	abstract = {The composition and dynamics of the skin bacterial and fungal microbiome
   is thought to influence host-pathogen defence. This microbial community
   is shaped by host captivity, diet, and microbial interactions between
   bacterial and fungal components. However, there remains little
   understanding of how specific micronutrients influence bacterial and
   fungal microbiome composition and their inter-domain interactions during
   rewilding of captive-bred animals. This study experimentally
   investigated the effect of dietary beta-carotene supplementation and
   subsequent field release on bacterial and fungal microbiome composition
   and dynamics using the Southern Corroboree frog (Pseudophryne
   corroboree) as a model system. We found large-scale diversification of
   bacterial communities post-release and similar diversification of fungal
   communities. The rewilded fungal mycobiome was more transient and
   demonstrated stronger temporal and micro-spatial fluctuations than the
   bacterial microbiome. Accounting for temporal and spatial factors, we
   found strong residual associations between bacterial members, yet
   limited evidence for inter-domain associations, suggesting that
   co-occurrence patterns between bacterial and fungal communities are
   largely a result of shared responses to the environment rather than
   direct interactions. Lastly, we found supplementation of dietary
   beta-carotene in captivity had no impact on post-release microbiome

	abstract = {Research on the amphibian skin microbiota has focused on identifying
   bacterial taxa that deter a pathogenic chytrid fungus, and on describing
   patterns of microbiota variation. However, it remains unclear how
   environmental variation affects amphibian skin bacterial communities,
   and whether the overall functional diversity of the amphibian skin
   microbiota is associated to such variation. We sampled skin microbial
   communities from one dendrobatoid frog species across an environmental
   gradient along the Panama Canal, and from three dendrobatoid frog
   species before and after the onset of the wet season in one site. We
   found frog skin microbial alpha diversity to be highest in frogs from
   sites with low soil pH, but no clear effect of the onset of the wet
   season. However, we found frog skin microbial community structure to be
   affected by soil pH and the onset of the wet season, which also resulted
   in a decrease in between-sample variation. Across the sampled frog
   species, bacterial functional groups changed with the onset of the wet
   season, with certain bacterial functional groups entirely disappearing
   and others differing in their relative abundances. In particular, we
   found the proportion of Bd-inhibitory bacteria to correlate with mean
   soil pH, and to increase in two of the frog species with the onset of
   the wet season. Taken together, our results suggest that structure and
   predicted function of amphibian bacterial skin communities may be
   influenced by environmental variables such as pH and precipitation, site
   effects, and host effects.},

   and provides the first line of defense against invading pathogens. Thus,
   skin surfaces harbor communities of microbes that are interacting with

   communities closely tied to their host species, but few studies have
   compared bacterial communities between amphibians and other,
   non-amphibian sympatric animals. Notably, skin microbes on reptiles have
   gained little attention. We used next-generation sequencing technology

   Northern Territory of Australia. We found bacterial communities had
   higher richness and diversity on lizards than frogs, with different
   community composition between reptiles and amphibians and among species.
   Core bacteria on the three lizard species overlapped by over 100
   operational taxonomic units. The bacterial communities were similar
   within species of frogs and lizards, but the communities tended to be
   more similar between lizard species than between frog species and when
   comparing lizards with frogs. The diverse bacteria found on lizards

@article{Ramesh2017,
	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Formalin is widely used to fix histological preparations and as preservatives in embalming solutions and is an age-long practice in medical laboratories. It is generally accepted that the risk of contracting infections is relatively high among medical laboratory workers and pathologists. Recent studies have, however, suggested that formalin does not effectively inactivate all kinds of microbes in formalin-fixed tissue (FFT). Long time preserved tissues in formalin may develop growth of microbes on the surface of the formalin. AIMS AND OBJECTIVES: The purpose of the study is to determine the growth of microorganisms on the surface of FFTs. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Fifty-one containers of 10% formalin with fixed tissues and undiscarded formalin solution not containing tissues of years 2013-2015 (17 in each year) were selected, and samples for inoculation onto the cysteine lactose electrolyte deficient agar plates were taken from the surface of the FFT using sterile cotton tips. The growth of the colonies was checked for after 48 h. RESULTS: Out of 51 samples from 2013 to 2015, 17 had shown growth of microbial colonies. Six out of 17 samples of 2013, 7 out of 17 of 2014 and 4 out of 17 samples of 2015 had colonies of microbes on agar plates. Gram-negative bacilli, Bacillus subtilis and micrococci were mostly found. CONCLUSION: There were viable microbes on the surfaces of formalin solution containing pathology tissue. Since cross-contamination by microbes may occur during regrossing or processing, protocols to decrease cross-contamination should be instituted.},

@article{Tin2014,
	abstract = {Ancient and archival DNA samples are valuable resources for the study of diverse historical processes. In particular, museum specimens provide access to biotas distant in time and space, and can provide insights into ecological and evolutionary changes over time. However, archival specimens are difficult to handle; they are often fragile and irreplaceable, and typically contain only short segments of denatured DNA. Here we present a set of tools for processing such samples for state-of-the-art genetic analysis. First, we report a protocol for minimally destructive DNA extraction of insect museum specimens, which produced sequenceable DNA from all of the samples assayed. The 11 specimens analyzed had fragmented DNA, rarely exceeding 100 bp in length, and could not be amplified by conventional PCR targeting the mitochondrial cytochrome oxidase I gene. Our approach made these samples amenable to analysis with commonly used next-generation sequencing-based molecular analytic tools, including RAD-tagging and shotgun genome re-sequencing. First, we used museum ant specimens from three species, each with its own reference genome, for RAD-tag mapping. Were able to use the degraded DNA sequences, which were sequenced in full, to identify duplicate reads and filter them prior to base calling. Second, we re-sequenced six Hawaiian Drosophila species, with millions of years of divergence, but with only a single available reference genome. Despite a shallow coverage of 0.37 $\pm$ 0.42 per base, we could recover a sufficient number of overlapping SNPs to fully resolve the species tree, which was consistent with earlier karyotypic studies, and previous molecular studies, at least in the regions of the tree that these studies could resolve. Although developed for use with degraded DNA, all of these techniques are readily applicable to more recent tissue, and are suitable for liquid handling automation.},

What made these DNA sequences exceptional was that they were derived from 140- and 2400-year-old specimens. However, ancient DNA research, defined broadly as the retrieval of DNA sequences from museum specimens, archaeological finds, fossil remains, and other unusual sources of DNA, only really became feasible with the advent of techniques for the enzymatic amplification of specific DNA sequences. Today, reports of analyses of specimens hundreds, thousands, and even millions of years old are almost commonplace. But can all these results be believed?

@article{Staats2013,
	abstract = {Unlocking the vast genomic diversity stored in natural history collections would create unprecedented opportunities for genome-scale evolutionary, phylogenetic, domestication and population genomic studies. Many researchers have been discouraged from using historical specimens in molecular studies because of both generally limited success of DNA extraction and the challenges associated with PCR-amplifying highly degraded DNA. In today's next-generation sequencing (NGS) world, opportunities and prospects for historical DNA have changed dramatically, as most NGS methods are actually designed for taking short fragmented DNA molecules as templates. Here we show that using a standard multiplex and paired-end Illumina sequencing approach, genome-scale sequence data can be generated reliably from dry-preserved plant, fungal and insect specimens collected up to 115 years ago, and with minimal destructive sampling. Using a reference-based assembly approach, we were able to produce the entire nuclear genome of a 43-year-old Arabidopsis thaliana (Brassicaceae) herbarium specimen with high and uniform sequence coverage. Nuclear genome sequences of three fungal specimens of 22--82 years of age (Agaricus bisporus, Laccaria bicolor, Pleurotus ostreatus) were generated with 81.4--97.9% exome coverage. Complete organellar genome sequences were assembled for all specimens. Using de novo assembly we retrieved between 16.2--71.0% of coding sequence regions, and hence remain somewhat cautious about prospects for de novo genome assembly from historical specimens. Non-target sequence contaminations were observed in 2 of our insect museum specimens. We anticipate that future museum genomics projects will perhaps not generate entire genome sequences in all cases (our specimens contained relatively small and low-complexity genomes), but at least generating vital comparative genomic data for testing (phylo)genetic, demographic and genetic hypotheses, that become increasingly more horizontal. Furthermore, NGS of historical DNA enables recovering crucial genetic information from old type specimens that to date have remained mostly unutilized and, thus, opens up a new frontier for taxonomic research as well.},

@article{Sampaio2023,
	abstract = {Uropeltidae is a clade of small fossorial snakes (ca. 64 extant species) endemic to peninsular India and Sri Lanka. Uropeltid taxonomy has been confusing, and the status of some species has not been revised for over a century. Attempts to revise uropeltid systematics and undertake evolutionary studies have been hampered by incompletely sampled and incompletely resolved phylogenies. To address this issue, we take advantage of historical museum collections, including type specimens, and apply genome-wide shotgun (GWS) sequencing, along with recent field sampling (using Sanger sequencing) to establish a near-complete multilocus species-level phylogeny (ca. 87% complete at species level). This results in a phylogeny that supports the monophyly of all genera (if Brachyophidium is considered a junior synonym of Teretrurus), and provides a firm platform for future taxonomic revision. Sri Lankan uropeltids are probably monophyletic, indicating a single colonisation event of this island from Indian ancestors. However, the position of Rhinophis goweri (endemic to Eastern Ghats, southern India) is unclear and warrants further investigation, and evidence that it may nest within the Sri Lankan radiation indicates a possible recolonisation event. DNA sequence data and morphology suggest that currently recognised uropeltid species diversity is substantially underestimated. Our study highlights the benefits of integrating museum collections in molecular genetic analyses and their role in understanding the systematics and evolutionary history of understudied organismal groups.},

	abstract = {The use of museum specimens for research in microbial evolutionary ecology remains an under-utilized investigative dimension with important potential. Despite this potential, there remain barriers in methodology and analysis to the wide-spread adoption of museum specimens for such studies. Here, we hypothesized that there would be significant differences in taxonomic prediction and related diversity among sample type (museum or fresh) and sequencing strategy (medium-depth shotgun metagenomic or 16S rRNA gene). We found dramatically higher predicted diversity from shotgun metagenomics when compared to 16S rRNA gene sequencing in museum and fresh samples, with this differential being larger in museum specimens. Broadly confirming these hypotheses, the highest diversity found in fresh samples was with shotgun sequencing using the Rep200 reference inclusive of viruses and microeukaryotes, followed by the WoL reference database. In museum-specimens, community diversity metrics also differed significantly between sequencing strategies, with the alpha-diversity ACE differential being significantly greater than the same comparisons made for fresh specimens. Beta diversity results were more variable, with significance dependent on reference databases used. Taken together, these findings demonstrate important differences in diversity results and prompt important considerations for future experiments and downstream analyses aiming to incorporate microbiome datasets from museum specimens.},

@article{Kruger2020,
	abstract = {Describing the structure and function of the amphibian cutaneous microbiome has gained importance with the spread of Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis (Bd), the fungal pathogen that can cause the skin disease chytridiomycosis. Sampling amphibian skin microbiota is needed to characterize current infection status and to help predict future susceptibility to Bd based on microbial composition since some skin microbes have antifungal capabilities that may confer disease resistance. Here, I use 16S rRNA sequencing to describe the composition and structure of the cutaneous microbiota of six species of amphibians. Frog skin samples were also tested for Bd, and I found 11.8% Bd prevalence among all individuals sampled (n = 76). Frog skin microbiota varied by host species and sampling site, but did not differ among Bd-positive and Bd-negative individuals. These results suggest that bacterial composition reflects host species and the environment, but does not reflect Bd infection among the species sampled here. Of the bacterial OTUs identified using an indicator species analysis as strongly associated with amphibians, significantly more indicator OTUs were putative anti-Bd taxa than would be expected based on the proportion of anti-Bd OTUs among all frog OTUs, suggesting strong associations between host species and anti-Bd OTUs. This relationship may partially explain why some of these frogs are asymptomatic carriers of Bd, but more work is needed to determine the other factors that contribute to interspecific variation in Bd susceptibility. This work provides important insights on inter- and intra-specific variation in microbial community composition, putative function, and disease dynamics in populations of amphibians that appear to be coexisting with Bd.},

@article{Hykin2015,
	abstract = {For 150 years or more, specimens were routinely collected and deposited in natural history collections without preserving fresh tissue samples for genetic analysis. In the case of most herpetological specimens (i.e. amphibians and reptiles), attempts to extract and sequence DNA from formalin-fixed, ethanol-preserved specimens---particularly for use in phylogenetic analyses---has been laborious and largely ineffective due to the highly fragmented nature of the DNA. As a result, tens of thousands of specimens in herpetological collections have not been available for sequence-based phylogenetic studies. Massively parallel High-Throughput Sequencing methods and the associated bioinformatics, however, are particularly suited to recovering meaningful genetic markers from severely degraded/fragmented DNA sequences such as DNA damaged by formalin-fixation. In this study, we compared previously published DNA extraction methods on three tissue types subsampled from formalin-fixed specimens of Anolis carolinensis, followed by sequencing. Sufficient quality DNA was recovered from liver tissue, making this technique minimally destructive to museum specimens. Sequencing was only successful for the more recently collected specimen (collected ~30 ybp). We suspect this could be due either to the conditions of preservation and/or the amount of tissue used for extraction purposes. For the successfully sequenced sample, we found a high rate of base misincorporation. After rigorous trimming, we successfully mapped 27.93% of the cleaned reads to the reference genome, were able to reconstruct the complete mitochondrial genome, and recovered an accurate phylogenetic placement for our specimen. We conclude that the amount of DNA available, which can vary depending on specimen age and preservation conditions, will determine if sequencing will be successful. The technique described here will greatly improve the value of museum collections by making many formalin-fixed specimens available for genetic analysis.},

	abstract = {Natural history collections provide an immense record of biodiversity on Earth. These repositories have traditionally been used to address fundamental questions in biogeography, systematics and conservation. However, they also hold the potential for studying evolution directly. While some of the best direct observations of evolution have come from long-term field studies or from experimental studies in the laboratory, natural history collections are providing new insights into evolutionary change in natural populations. By comparing phenotypic and genotypic changes in populations through time, natural history collections provide a window into evolutionary processes. Recent studies utilizing this approach have revealed some dramatic instances of phenotypic change over short timescales in response to presumably strong selective pressures. In some instances, evolutionary change can be paired with environmental change, providing a context for potential selective forces. Moreover, in a few cases, the genetic basis of phenotypic change is well understood, allowing for insight into adaptive change at multiple levels. These kinds of studies open the door to a wide range of previously intractable questions by enabling the study of evolution through time, analogous to experimental studies in the laboratory, but amenable to a diversity of species over longer timescales in natural populations.},

	abstract = {<p>Antarctic specimens collected during various research expeditions are preserved in natural history collections around the world potentially offering a cornucopia of morphological and molecular data. Historical samples of marine species are, however, often preserved in formaldehyde which may render them useless for genetic analysis. We sampled stomachs and hindguts from 225 <italic>Trematomus</italic> specimens from the Natural History Museum London. These samples were initially collected between 20 and 100 years ago and fixed in either formaldehyde or ethanol. A 313 bp fragment of the cytochrome c oxidase subunit I (COI) was amplified and sequenced for prey item identification in the stomach and a 450 bp region of the 16S rRNA gene to investigate microbiome composition in the gut system. Both data sets were characterized by large dropout rates during extensive quality controls. Eventually, no unambiguous results regarding stomach content (COI) were retained, possibly due to degraded DNA, inefficient primers and contamination. In contrast, reliable microbiome composition data (16S rRNA) was obtained from 26 samples. These data showed a correlation in change of microbiome composition with fish size as well as year of the catch, indicating a microbiome shift throughout ontogeny and between samples from different decades. A comparison with contemporary samples indicated that the intestinal microbiome of <italic>Trematomus</italic> may have drastically changed within the last century. Further extensive studies are needed to confirm these patterns with higher sample numbers. Molecular analyses of museum stored fish can provide novel micro evolutionary insights that may benefit current efforts to prioritize conservation units in the Southern Ocean.</p>},

@article{Chalifour2022,
	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Museum biological specimens provide a unique means of gathering ecological information that spans wide temporal ranges. Museum specimens can also provide information on the microbial communities that persist within the host specimen. Together, these provide researchers valuable opportunities to study long-term trends and mechanisms of microbial community change. The effects of decades-long museum preservation on host-microbial communities have not been systematically assessed. The University of Colorado's Museum of Natural History has densely sampled Oreohelix strigosa (Rocky Mountainsnail) for the past century; many are preserved in ethanol, which provides an excellent opportunity to explore how the microbiome changes across time in preservation. RESULTS: We used 16S rRNA (ribosomal ribonucleic acid) gene amplicon sequencing to examine Oreohelix strigosa gut microbiomes from museum specimens across a 98-year range, as well as within short-term preservation treatments collected in 2018. Treatment groups included samples extracted fresh, without preservation; samples starved prior to extraction; and samples preserved for 1 month, 6 months, and 9 months. General microbiome composition was similar across all years. Sample groups belonging to specific years, or specific short-term treatments, showed unique associations with select bacterial taxa. Collection year was not a significant predictor of microbial richness, though unpreserved short-term treatments showed significantly higher richness than preserved treatments. While the year was a significant factor in microbiome composition, it did not explain much of the variation across samples. The location was a significant driver of community composition and explained more of the variability. CONCLUSIONS: This study is the first to examine animal host-associated microbiome change across a period of nearly one century. Generally, geographic location was a greater factor in shaping gut microbiome composition, rather than a year collected. Consistent patterns across this temporal range indicate that historic specimens can answer many ecological questions surrounding the host-associated microbiome. Video Abstract.},

In this chapter, we discuss different methods for preparing ancient DNA for NGS, and various analytical issues specific to NGS data output from ancient DNA sources. We focus mainly on birds and discuss several case studies where NGS has been applied to very old museum specimens, like subfossils, as well as younger specimens, like those from museum study skins collected in the last century. Although few recently published studies using NGS are about ancient DNA from bird museum specimens, the number is expected to grow rapidly. The case studies demonstrate that systematics and taxonomy are important applications of NGS to museum specimens, and that plenty remains to be learned from specimens about population-level processes such as the genetics of changes in population size, some of which have led to extinction. Better methods of extracting ancient DNA from museum specimens are badly needed, as well as careful consideration of how the research community archives DNA extractions and the billions of DNA sequencing reads now being produced from museum specimens on NGS platforms. Methods for correcting errors that occur during NGS, as well as those introduced during the process of DNA degradation in the specimen itself (e.g., deamination), are in development, but easy-to-use pipelines are still lacking. In sum, although methods are still in development, the field of next-generation museum genomics is burgeoning, with high potential to extend the utility of museum specimens in bird systematics, historical demography, and conservation.},

	abstract = {Skin microbiota of Gulf of Mexico fishes were investigated by ribosomal internal spacer analysis (RISA) and 16S rRNA gene sequencing. A total of 102 fish specimens representing six species (Mugil cephalus, Lutjanus campechanus, Cynoscion nebulosus, Cynoscion arenarius, Micropogonias undulatus, and Lagodon rhomboides) were sampled at regular intervals throughout a year. The skin microbiota from each individual fish was analyzed by RISA and produced complex profiles with 23 bands on average. Similarities between RISA profiles ranged from 97.5% to 4.0%. At 70% similarity, 11 clusters were defined, each grouping individuals from the same fish species. Multidimensional scaling and analysis of similarity correlated the RISA-defined clusters with geographic locality, date, and fish species. Global R values indicated that fish species was the most indicative variable for group separation. Analysis of 16S rRNA gene sequences (from pooled samples of 10 individual fish for each fish species) showed that the Proteobacteria was the predominant phylum in skin microbiota, followed by the Firmicutes and the Actinobacteria. The distribution and abundance of bacterial sequences were different among all species analyzed. Aeribacillus was found in all fish species representing 19% of all clones sequenced, while some genera were fish species-specific (Neorickettsia in M. cephalus and Microbacterium in L. campechanus). Our data provide evidence for the existence of specific skin microbiota associated with particular fish species.},

ABSTRACT 
Teleost fish represent an invaluable repertoire of host species to study the factors shaping animal-associated microbiomes. Several studies have shown that the phylogenetic structure of the fish gut microbiome is driven by species-specific (e.g., host ancestry, genotype, or diet) and habitat-specific (e.g., hydrochemical parameters and bacterioplankton composition) factors. However, our understanding of other host-associated microbial niches, such as the skin mucus microbiome, remains limited. The goal of our study was to explore simultaneously the phylogenetic structure of the fish skin mucus and gut microbiome and compare the effect of species- and habitat-specific drivers on the structure of microbial communities in both tissues. We sampled 114 wild fish from 6 populations of 3 ecologically and phylogenetically contrasting Amazonian teleost species. Water samples were collected at each site, and 10 physicochemical parameters were characterized. The skin mucus, gut, and water microbial communities were characterized using a metabarcoding approach targeting the V3-V4 regions of the 16S rRNA. Our results showed a significant distinction between the phylogenetic profile and diversity of the microbiome from each microbial niche. Skin mucus and bacterioplankton communities were significantly closer in composition than gut and free-living communities. Species-specific factors mostly modulated gut bacterial communities, while the skin mucus microbiome was predominantly associated with environmental physicochemistry and bacterioplankton community structure. These results suggest that the variable skin mucus community is a relevant target for the development of microbial biomarkers of environmental status, while the more conserved gut microbiome is better suited to study long-term host-microbe interactions over evolutionary time scales.

Collaborative efforts and multidisciplinary studies, crossing the boundary between environmental and medical microbiology, have allowed specific environmental, animal and human microbiomes to be characterized. One of the main challenges for microbial ecology is to link the phylogenetic diversity of host-associated microbes to their functional roles within the community. Much remains to be learned on the way microbes colonize the skin of different living organisms and the way the skin microbiome reacts to the surrounding environment (air, water, etc.). In this review, we discuss examples of recent studies that have used modern technology to provide insights into microbial communities in water and on skin, such as those in natural resources (thermal spring water), large mammals (humpback whales) and humans (the skin microbiome). The results of these studies demonstrate how a greater understanding of the structure and functioning of microbiota, together with their interactions with the environment, may facilitate the discovery of new probiotics or postbiotics, provide indicators for the quality of the environment, and show how changes in lifestyle and living environment, such as urbanization, can impact on the skin microbiome and skin health and disease in humans.},

How the genetic wealth of the microbiota affects all aspects of the holobiont's (host plus all of its associated microorganisms) fitness (adaptation, survival, development, growth and reproduction) and evolution is reviewed, using selected coral, insect, squid, plant, and human/mouse published experimental results. The data are discussed within the framework of the hologenome theory of evolution, which demonstrates that changes in environmental parameters, for example, diet, can cause rapid changes in the diverse microbiota, which not only can benefit the holobiont in the short term but also can be transmitted to offspring and lead to long lasting cooperations. As acquired characteristics (microbes) are heritable, consideration of the holobiont as a unit of selection in evolution leads to neo-Lamarckian principles within a Darwinian framework. The potential application of these principles can be seen in the growing fields of prebiotics and probiotics.},

	abstract = {ABSTRACT 
The skin is the first line of defense between an animal and its environment, and disruptions in skin-associated microorganisms can be linked to an animal's health and nutritional state. To better understand the skin microbiome of large whales, high-throughput sequencing of partial small subunit rRNA genes was used to study the skin-associated bacteria of 89 seemingly healthy humpback whales (Megaptera novaeangliae) sampled along the Western Antarctic Peninsula (WAP) during early (2010) and late (2013) austral summers. Six core groups of bacteria were present in 93\% or more of all humpback skin samples. A shift was observed in the average relative abundances of these core bacteria over time, with the emergence of four additional core groups of bacteria that corresponded to a decrease in water temperature, possibly caused by season- or foraging-related changes in skin biochemistry that influenced microbial growth, or other temporal factors. The skin microbiome differed between whales sampled at several regional locations along the WAP, suggesting that environmental factors or population may also influence the whale skin microbiome. Overall, the skin microbiome of humpback whales appears to provide insight into animal- and environment-related factors and may serve as a useful indicator for animal health or ecosystem alterations.
IMPORTANCE The microbiomes of wild animals are currently understudied but may provide information about animal health and/or animal-environment interactions. In the largest sampling of any marine mammal microbiome, this study demonstrates conservation in the skin microbiome of 89 seemingly healthy humpback whales sampled in the Western Antarctic Peninsula, with shifts in the bacterial community composition related to temporal and regional variability. This study is important because it suggests that the skin microbiome of humpback whales could provide insight into animal nutritional or seasonal/environment-related factors, which are becoming increasingly important to recognize due to unprecedented rates of climate change and anthropogenic impact on ocean ecosystems.},

The tremendous ecological and morphological diversity of this clade, with apparent specializations for burrowing, terrestrial, semi-aquatic, and arboreal lifestyle, suggests an evolutionary process of adaptive radiation. Despite this spectacular diversity, this and many other questions of evolutionary processes have received little formal study because until now the phylogeny of this spececies-rich clade has remained uncertain. Here we reconstruct a phylogeny for Asterophryinae with greatly increased taxon and genetic sampling relative to prior studies. We use Maximum Likelihood and Bayesian Inference methods to produce the most robust and comprehensive phylogeny to date containing 155 species using 3 nuclear and 2 mitochondrial loci. We also perform a time calibration analysis to estimate the age of the clade. We find support for the monophyly of Asterophryinae as well as need for taxonomic reclassification of several genera. Furthermore, we find increased rates of speciation across the clade supporting the hypothesis of rapid radiation. Lastly, we found that adding taxa to the analysis produced more robust phylogenetic results over adding loci.},

	abstract = {Skin barrier structure and function is essential to human health. Hitherto unrecognized functions of epidermal keratinocytes show that the skin plays an important role in adapting whole-body physiology to changing environments, including the capacity to produce a wide variety of hormones, neurotransmitters and cytokine that can potentially influence whole-body states, and quite possibly, even emotions. Skin microbiota play an integral role in the maturation and homeostatic regulation of keratinocytes and host immune networks with systemic implications. As our primary interface with the external environment, the biodiversity of skin habitats is heavily influenced by the biodiversity of the ecosystems in which we reside. Thus, factors which alter the establishment and health of the skin microbiome have the potential to predispose to not only cutaneous disease, but also other inflammatory non-communicable diseases (NCDs). Indeed, disturbances of the stratum corneum have been noted in allergic diseases (eczema and food allergy), psoriasis, rosacea, acne vulgaris and with the skin aging process. The built environment, global biodiversity losses and declining nature relatedness are contributing to erosion of diversity at a micro-ecological level, including our own microbial habitats. This emphasises the importance of ecological perspectives in overcoming the factors that drive dysbiosis and the risk of inflammatory diseases across the life course.},
